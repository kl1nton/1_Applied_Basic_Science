    - Especially in immunosuppressed patients
- Classic location for primary infection is around the lobar fissures, either
    - In the _upper part of the lower lobe_, or
    - In the _lower part of the upper lobe_
    
**Notes**
- If _Ghon focus_ also involves infection of surrounding lymph nodes
    - It is known as the Ghon's (or primary) complex

	D. Multiple hamartomatous polyps throughout the colon 
	E. 100% risk of carcinoma within 30 years of diagnosis

#### Answer: E. 100% risk of carcinoma within 30 years of diagnosis - TRUE
- Although most colonic polyps occur sporadically, there are several conditions in which colonic polyposis is familial and sometimes associated with extra-intestinal abnormalities.
- Familial polyposis coli is usually transmitted autosomal dominant (AD)
	- Characterised by multiple adenomatous colonic polyps 
	- Minimum of 100 polyps necessary for diagnosis
- As with sporadic adenomatous polyps, there is a risk of malignancy
	- This increases to **100% within 30 years of diagnosis**
	- Tx: Panprotocolectomy is, therefore, usually recommended

**Notes**
- **Gardner's syndrome**
	- A condition associated with colonic polyposis
	- Consists of: 
		1. Multiple oesteomas; 
		2. Fibromatosis; and 
		3. Cutaneous cysts
- **Turcot's syndrome** 
	- Association of colonic polyposis with central nervous system (CNS) tumours 

### Q3.6 
A 52-year-old man complaining of severe chest pain is brought to the Emergency Department. Preliminary investigations are suggestive of type A aortic dissection. 

Which one of the following pathological conditions is most commonly associated with aortic dissection? 

	A. Atherosclerosis 
	B. Cystic medial necrosis 
	C. Mycobacterial aortitis 
	D. Streptococcal endocarditis with aortitis 
	E. Syphilitic aortitis

#### Answer: B. Cystic medial necrosis - TRUE
- Aortic dissection occurs 2--3 times more frequently than ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
- Usually causes by **cystic medial necrosis** (_Erdheim's mucoid degeneration_) of aorta
	- Less commonly of its major branches, including the coronary arteries
- Fragmentation of elastic fibres and mucoid degeneration occur in the media
	- Most severe in the area of junction of its middle and outer thirds
		- The typical location of the dissection
- Hypertension and Marfan's syndrome predispose to aortic dissection
	- Intimal tear usually begins in ascending aorta

**Notes**
- Aortitis in tertiary syphilis is caused by obliterative endarteritis of the *adventitial vasa vasorum* of the aorta
	- Causing ischaemic medial injury and aneurysmal dilation of the proximal aorta
- Atherosclerosis is a more common causes of aortic aneurysm
	- Usually occurs distal to the renal arteries
- Aneurysms of the blood vessels because of infection - so-called mycotic aneurysms - are common

### Q3.7

	A. Diabetic glomerulopathy 
	B. Goldblatt’s kidney 
	C. Goodpasture’s syndrome 
	D. Lupus nephritis 
	E. Renal vein thrombosis
	
#### Answer: C. Goodpasture's syndrome - TRUE
- In Goodpasture's syndrome, circulating antibodies reactive to glomerular basement membrane, which is their specific antigen
	- Bind to it in a linear pattern along its entire length
- IgG is deposited in basement membrane, along with complement
- There are also focal interruptions of glomerular basement membrane
	- Along with deposits of fibrin, as seen with electron microscope (EM)

### Q3.8 
Paget’s disease, otherwise known as _osteitis deformans_, is a chronic disorder that typically results in enlarged and deformed bones. 

Which one of the following tumours is associated with Paget’s disease of bone?

	A. Ewing’s sarcoma - F
	B. Giant cell tumour - F
	C. Osteosarcoma 
	D. Metastatic duct carcinoma of the breast 
	E. Multiple enchondromas

#### Answer: C. Osteosarcoma - TRUE
- Paget's disease of bone may lead to **osteosarcoma**
- It should not be confused with _Paget's disease of the breast_, which is closely associated with an underlying **duct carcinoma**

### Q3.9
A 58-year-old man was anticoagulated with warfarin following an embolic stroke. Which one of the following statements regarding arterial emboli is **false**? 

	A. Arterial emboli rarely embolise to the lower extremities 
	B. Emboli from infective endocarditis can cause septic infarcts 
	C. Embolisation to the middle cerebral artery can be fatal 
	D. Most arterial emboli arise from cardiac thrombi 
	E. Most arterial emboli cause infarction

#### Answer: A. Arterial emboli rarely embolise to the lower extremities - TRUE
- Most arterial emboli arise from thrombi in the heart
	- 65% in left ventricle (LV) 
	- 20% in left atrium (LA)
- Less common sources of arterial emboli are:
	- Thrombi in ulcerated aortic plaque
	- Aortic aneurysms
	- Abnormal cardiac valves
- Arterial emboli follow varied paths, but
	- Majority (70%) travel to and lodge in _lower extremities_
	
**Notes**
- Those that embolize in the brain via the middle cerebral artery (MCA) may be rapidly fatal
- Most arterial emboli are non-septic
	- Septic emboli usually arise from infective endocarditis
	- They are re likely to produce septic infarcts at the site of embolisation

### Q3.10
A biopsy of an excised lump shows what appears to be an abnormal amount and arrangement of normal tissue that is appropriate or normal for the area in which the tissue arises. This is best described as: 
    
	A. Carcinosarcoma 
	B. Embryonal tumour 
	C. Hamartoma 
	D. Mixed tumour 
	E. Teratoma

#### Answer: C. Hamartoma - TRUE
- **Definition**: a hamartoma is a conglomeration of tissues that are _normal to the area_ but haphazardly arranged in an abnormal fashion

**Notes**
- All of the neoplasias listed contain a mixture of different cell types
	- Only in a hamartoma are the cells *normal to that particular area*
- There are best regarded as developmental anomalies rather than true neoplasms
- Hamartoma are **never** malignant and therefore, do **not** metastasise


Questions 3.11-3.20
-------------------

5/10 = 50% - F: 11, 13, 14, 16, 20

### Q3.11
Which one of the following disease states is characterised by a kidney biopsy specimen that shows subendothelial granular electron-dense deposits? 

	A. Goodpasture’s syndrome
	B. Membranous glomerulonephritis 
	C. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis 
	D. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis 
	E. Systemic lupus erythematosus

#### Answer: B. Membranous glomerulonephritis - *FALSE* = E. Systemic lupus erythematosus - TRUE

Granular subendothelial immune deposits and proliferation of mesangial and endothelial cells is nearly diagnostic of systemic lupus erythematosus. In systemic lupus erythematosus, the immune complexes are located between the endothelial cells and the glomerular basement membrane. Later in the course of this disease, the immune complexes may also be seen in the subepithelial region.

### Q3.12
Macrophages phagocytose cellular debris and pathogens either as stationary or mobile cells. Which of the following cells are the _precursors of macrophages_?

	A. Basophils 
	B. Eosinophils 
	C. Lymphocytes 
	D. Monocytes 
	E. Neutrophils

#### Answer: D. Monocytes - TRUE

In response to pinocytosis of serum proteins or ingestions of foreign material, monocytes enlarge and synthesise increased amounts of lysosomal enzymes and thereby are transformed into more active phagocytes called macrophages. Blood monocytes are precursors of pulmonary alveolar macrophages, spleen macrophages, and fixed macrophages of the monocyte macrophage system (the reticuloendothelial system).

### Q3.13
A 41-year-old unconscious woman was brought to the Emergency Department. In view of history of severe headache prior to becoming unconscious a CT scan was requested, which was suggestive of subarachnoid haemorrhage. Which one of the following is the most common cause of _spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage_? 

	A. Arteriovenous malformation 
	B. Blood dyscrasia 
	C. Intracranial congenital aneurysm 
	D. Primary brain tumour 
	E. Tumour metastatic to the brain

#### Answer: A. Arteriovenous malformation - *FALSE* = C. Intracranial congenital aneurysm - TRUE

The most common cause of spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage, and the cerebrovascular lesion most often responsible for death in young adults, is a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. Intracranial congenital aneurysms (berry aneurysms) account for 85% of spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhages. Such aneurysms are seen in 4% of adults at autopsy; in 20% of these cases they are multiple. Aneurysm formation is thought to be related to a combination of congenital and acquired factors. A defect in the media of the artery wall is believed to be the major congenital defect and is particularly significant at arterial bifurcation sites. Atherosclerosis and hypertension appear to be the most significant acquired factors causing fragmentation of the elastic lamina. Other causes of spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage include arteriovenous malformations (10% of cases) and tumours, blood dyscrasias, and mycotic aneurysms (5% of cases combined).


### Q3.14
An icteric 6-weeks-old baby was found to have cholestatic jaundice. Which one of the following conditions is the most common cause of _neonatal cholestasis_? 

	A. Budd–chiari syndrome 
	B. Choledochal cyst 
	C. Extrahepatic biliary atresia 
	D. Intrahepatic biliary atresia 
	E. Primary biliary cirrhosis

#### Answer: D. Intrahepatic biliary atresia - *FALSE* = C. Extrahepatic biliary atresia - TRUE

Neonatal cholestasis in most cases results from bile duct obstruction, the most common cause (more than 90% of cases) of which is extrahepatic biliary atresia (EBA). Clinically, EBA may mimic neonatal hepatitis, which is an abnormality of unknown cause and requires a diagnosis by exclusion. 1-Antitrypsin deficiency, metabolic disorders and infectious processes must be ruled out before a diagnosis of neonatal hepatitis can be made. Histologically, neonatal hepatitis and EBA may appear similar, in particular, both generally contain giant cells. EBA, however, usually can be identified by evidence of large biliary duct obstruction when examined microscopically. The cause of EBA is still undetermined. Originally, it was thought to represent a congenital anomaly. Some investigators consider it to be an acquired disorder secondary to neonatal hepatitis with cholangitis and sclerosis of large bile ducts, either in utero or in early neonatal life. Overall, few patients can be cured with standard therapy. The natural history involves progression to secondary biliary cirrhosis and death in early childhood. Liver transplantation is a viable alternative therapeutic approach in these patients. Neonatal cholestasis may also, but rarely, be caused by intrahepatic biliary atresia, which is characterised by choledochal cysts and the absence of bile duct elements in the liver. Primary biliary cirrhosis is seen in middle-aged people, typically women. In the Budd–chiari syndrome there is obstruction of the hepatic veins caused by a variety of processes.


### Q3.15
The first symptom of thyroid cancer most commonly is a nodule in the thyroid region of the neck. Which one of the following is the _most common primary malignant tumour of the thyroid gland_? 

	A. Anaplastic carcinoma - F
	B. Follicular carcinoma 
	C. Large cell carcinoma - F
	D. Medullary carcinoma - F
	E. Papillary carcinoma

#### Answer: E. Papillary carcinoma - TRUE

Papillary carcinoma is by far the most common malignant tumour of the thyroid gland. It occurs more frequently in women and presents in the 30–40 year age group. It is also the predominant cancer type in children with thyroid cancer, and in patients with thyroid cancer who have a history of radiation to the head and neck.


### Q3.16
Which one of the following features is _absent_ in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), an autoimmune disease of the liver?

    A. Bile duct destruction - F
    B. Cholestasis 
    C. Irregular regenerative nodules 
    D. Large lymphoid aggregates in the portal tracts 
    E. Prominent plasma cell infiltrate

#### Answer: B. Cholestasis - *FALSE* = C. Irregular regenerative nodules - TRUE

Primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune disease of the liver marked by the slow, progressive destruction of the bile canaliculi within the liver. When these ducts are damaged, bile builds up in the liver (cholestasis) and, over time, damages the tissue. This can lead to scarring, fibrosis and cirrhosis. Primary biliary cirrhosis was previously thought to be a rare disease, but more recent studies have shown that it may affect up to 1 in 3000–4000 people; the sex ratio is at least 9:1 (women to men). Biliary cirrhosis results in a fine and diffusely nodular liver. In secondary biliary cirrhosis the liver is also intensely green. In neither of the two types are irregular nodules found.


### Q3.17
Which cell types are most commonly seen in tissues with chronic inflammation? 

    A. Eosinophil leucocytes 
    B. Lymphocytes 
    C. Mast cells 
    D. Platelets - F
    E. Polymorphonuclear leucocytes

#### Answer: B. Lymphocytes - TRUE

The lymphocyte and monocyte series are the characteristic cells seen in more prolonged forms of inflammation, that is chronic inflammation. The eosinophils and the polymorphonuclear leucocytes usually are associated with early or acute inflammatory responses. The mast cell is involved in liberating histamine in early inflammation. The platelets, although they may aggregate, are not characteristic of either.


### Q3.18
Granulation tissue is characterised by: 
    
    A. Giant cells and fibroblasts 
    B. Giant cells and lymphocytes 
    C. Giant cells, plasma cells and lymphocytes 
    D. Neutrophils and necrotic tissue 
    E. Proliferation of new capillaries with fibroblasts and new collagen formation

#### Answer: E. Proliferation of new capillaries with fibroblasts and new collagen formation - TRUE

Granulation tissue is the first phase of the healing process at the end of acute inflammation. New capillaries proliferate in the tissue, with fibroblasts and the first laying down of new collagen, which eventually will largely become avascular scar tissue. It is not to be confused with granulomatous inflammation or granuloma, which is the hallmark of a form of chronic inflammation in which healing and the stimulation for damage occur concurrently.


### Q3.19
Which one of the following is the most common benign bone tumours that affects individuals under the age of 21 years? 

    A. Aneurysmal bone cyst - F
    B. Chondromyxoid fibroma 
    C. Giant cell tumour - F 
    D. Osteochondroma 
    E. Osteogenic sarcoma

### Answer: D. Osteochondroma - TRUE

Osteochondroma is also referred to as exostosis. It is benign new bone growth that often protrudes from the outer contour of bones and is capped by growing cartilage. The multifocal and clearly hereditary form of this lesion is known as hereditary multiple cartilaginous exostosis. Whether multiple or isolated, nearly 80% of these lesions are noted prior to the age of 21 years.


### Q3.20
Which one of the following is the most frequently encountered _colorectal lesion of epithelial derivation_? 

    A. Adenocarcinoma 
    B. Adenomatous polyp 
    C. Metaplastic polyp 
    D. Mixed adenomatous and villous polyp 
    E. Villous polyp

#### Answer: A. Adenocarcinoma - *FALSE* = C. Metaplastic polyp - TRUE

The most common type of polyp is a metaplastic polyp. These usually do not grow much more than 5mm in diameter and have almost no risk of becoming malignant. These polyps can be very similar in appearance to adenomatous polyps, the next most common type, which do have the potential to become malignant. About 50% of people aged 60 will have at least one adenomatous polyp of 1cm diameter or greater.


Questions 3.21-3.30
-------------------

4/10 = 40% - F: 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30

### Q3.21
Bronchial biopsy of a 58-year-old man who is a chronic smoker showed squamous metaplasia. Which of the following statements best describes metaplasia? 

    A. It is an irreversible change 
    B. It is an adaptive response 
    C. It occurs only in epithelium 
    D. It is characterised by cloudy swelling of cells - F
    E. It results from a change in the phenotype of a differentiated cell type - F

#### Answer: A. It is an irreversible change - *FALSE* = B. It is an adaptive response - TRUE

Metaplasia is a reversible change in which one adult cell type (epithelial or mesenchymal) is replaced by another. It may represent an adaptive substitution of cells that are sensitive to stress by cell types better able to withstand the adverse environment. The most common epithelial metaplasia is columnar to squamous, as occurs in the respiratory tract in response to chronic irritation. In those who are habitual cigarette smokers, the normal ciliated columnar epithelial cells of the trachea and bronchi are often replaced focally or widely by stratified squamous epithelial cells. Stones in the excretory ducts of the salivary glands, pancreas or bile ducts may cause replacement of the normal secretory columnar epithelium by non-functioning stratified squamous epithelium.


### Q3.22
A 60-year-old woman with a long history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus has had extensive black discoloration of the skin and soft tissue of her right foot and calf, with areas of yellowish exudate, for the past month. A mixed growth of aerobes and anaerobes is cultured from this exudate. A below-knee amputation is performed. The _amputation specimen sent to the histopathology laboratory_ is most likely to demonstrate which of the following pathological abnormalities? 

    A. Neoplasia 
    B. Coagulopathy 
    C. Haemosiderosis 
    D. Caseation necrosis 
    E. Gangrenous necrosis

#### Answer: E. Gangrenous necrosis - TRUE

Diabetes exacts a heavy toll on the vascular system. The hallmark of diabetic macrovascular disease is accelerated atherosclerosis involving the aorta and large- and medium-sized arteries. Gangrene is a typical complication of diabetes mellitus with peripheral vascular disease. Gangrene of the lower extremities, as a result of advanced vascular disease, is about 100 times more common in people with diabetes than in the general population. Although gangrenous necrosis is not a distinctive pattern of cell death, the term is still commonly used in surgical clinical practice. It is usually applied to a limb, generally the lower leg, that has lost its blood supply and has undergone coagulation necrosis. When bacterial infection is superimposed, coagulative necrosis is modified by the liquefactive action of the bacteria and the attracted leukocytes (so-called wet gangrene).


### Q3.23
A 22-year-old man who is a motorcyclist is involved in a high-impact road traffic accident on the motorway which results in multiple blunt trauma and lacerations to his lower extremities. The left femoral artery is lacerated, and he incurs extensive blood loss and remains hypotensive for hours during transport to the Emergency Department. On admission, his haematocrit is 15%. Which of the following tissues is most likely to sustain the _least damage as a result of prolonged hypotension_? 

    A. Small intestinal epithelium 
    B. Skeletal muscle 
    C. Retina - F
    D. Myocardium - F 
    E. Hippocampus - F

#### Answer: B. Skeletal muscle - TRUE

Skeletal muscle is the most likely tissue to resist damage caused by prolonged hypotension because it is the least metabolically active of the ones listed, and also able to function with anaerobic glycolysis. On the other hand, shock can often lead to ischaemic enteritis. The retinal neurons are very sensitive to hypoxia. The myocardium is very active metabolically and is likely to undergo ischaemic damage. Similarly, the neurons of the brain are very sensitive to hypoxia, and the hippocampus in particular.


### Q3.24
A histopathology report mentioned the term ‘fat necrosis’. Fat necrosis is a feature of: 
    
    A. Brain injury 
    B. Muscle injury - F
    C. Trauma to the bowel 
    D. Acute pancreatitis 
    E. Trauma to the uterus - F

#### Answer: A. Brain injury - *FALSE* = D. Acute pancreatitis - TRUE

Fat necrosis is descriptive of focal areas of fat destruction, typically occurring as a result of release of activated pancreatic lipases into the substance of the pancreas and the peritoneal cavity. This occurs in the calamitous abdominal emergency known as acute pancreatitis.

In this disorder, activated pancreatic enzymes escape from acinar cells and ducts, the activated enzymes liquefy fat cell membranes and the activated lipases split the triglyceride esters contained within fat cells. The released fatty acids combine with calcium to produce grossly visible chalky-white areas (fat saponification), which enable the surgeon and the pathologist to identify the lesions. On histological examination, the necrosis takes the form of foci of shadowy outlines of necrotic fat cells, with basophilic calcium deposits, surrounded by an inflammatory reaction.


### Q3.25
A fair-skinned child develops sunburn within 24 hours of exposure to sun. This is caused by: 
    
    A. Free radical injury 
    B. Ischaemic injury 
    C. Direct endothelial injury
    D. Chemical injury 
    E. Hypoxic injury

#### Answer: C. Direct endothelial injury - *FALSE* = A. Free radical injury - TRUE

Sunburn is a classic example of free radical injury. Free radicals are chemical species that have a single unpaired electron in an outer orbit. Energy created by this unstable configuration is released through reactions with adjacent molecules, such as inorganic or organic chemicals – proteins, lipids, carbohydrates – particularly with key molecules in membranes and nucleic acids. Moreover, free radicals initiate autocatalytic reactions, whereby molecules with which they react are themselves converted into free radicals to propagate the chain of damage. Exposure to ionising radiation or ultraviolet light can hydrolyse water into hydroxyl (OH) and hydrogen (H) free radicals.


### Q3.26
Report of a biopsy specimen sent to the histopathology laboratory came back claiming 'no granuloma seen'. The patient is most likely to have which of the following conditions? 

    A. Lepromatous leprosy 
    B. Tuberculosis (TB) 
    C. Coccidioidomycosis 
    D. Syphilis 
    E. Trypanosomiasis

#### Answer: B. Tuberculosis (TB) - *FALSE* = E. Trypanosomiasis - TRUE

A granuloma is a focus of chronic inflammation consisting of a microscopic aggregation of macrophages that are transformed into epithelium-like cells surrounded by a collar of mononuclear leukocytes, principally lymphocytes and occasionally plasma cells. In the usual haematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections, the epithelioid cells have a pale-pink granular cytoplasm with indistinct cell boundaries, often appearing to merge into each other. The nucleus is less dense than that of a lymphocyte, and oval or elongate, and may show folding of the nuclear membrane. Older granulomata develop an enclosing rim of fibroblasts and connective tissue. Frequently, epithelioid cells fuse to form giant cells in the periphery or sometimes in the centre of granulomata. Granulomata are a feature of TB, syphilis, coccidioidomycosis and lepromatous leprosy.


### Q3.27
A patient with an inflammatory condition was told by the consultant that he has features consistent with a _type II hypersensitivity reaction_. This patient is most likely to have which of the following disorders? 

    A. Polyarteritis nodosa - F 
    B. Reactive arthritis 
    C. Serum sickness 
    D. Graves’ disease - F
    E. Arthus reaction - F

#### Answer: B. Reactive arthritis - *FALSE* = D. Graves’ disease - TRUE

Type II hypersensitivity is mediated by antibodies directed towards antigens present on cell surfaces or the extracellular matrix. The antigenic determinants may be intrinsic to the cell membrane or matrix, or take the form of an exogenous antigen, such as a drug metabolite, that is adsorbed on a cell surface or matrix. In either case, the hypersensitivity reaction results from the binding of antibodies to normal or altered cell-surface antigens. Examples include autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, pemphigus vulgaris, vasculitis caused by ANCA (antibody to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens), acute rheumatic fever, myasthenia gravis, insulin-resistant diabetes, pernicious anaemia and Graves’ disease (hyperthyroidism).


### Q3.28
On receiving intravenous penicillin, a child develops urticaria, dyspnoea and generalised oedema immediately as a result of: 
    
    A. Type I hypersensitivity
    B. Type II hypersensitivity
    C. Type III hypersensitivity 
    D. Type IV hypersensitivity 
    E. Systemic immune complex disease

#### Answer: A. Type I hypersensitivity - TRUE

Hypersensitivity reaction to penicillin is a classic example of a type I hypersensitivity reaction. Immediate, or type I, hypersensitivity is a rapidly developing immunological reaction occurring within minutes after the combination of an antigen to an antibody bound to mast cells in individuals previously sensitised to the antigen. These reactions are often called an allergy, and the antigens that elicit them are allergens. Immediate hypersensitivity may occur as a systemic disorder or a local reaction. The systemic reaction usually follows injection of an antigen to which the host has become sensitised. Often within minutes a state of shock is produced, which is sometimes fatal. The nature of local reactions varies depending on the portal of entry of the allergen and may take the form of localised cutaneous swellings (skin allergy, hives), nasal and conjunctival discharge (allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis), hay fever, bronchial asthma or allergic gastroenteritis (food allergy).


### Q3.29
A 50-year-old marketing executive has complained of mild burning epigastric pain after meals for the past 3 years. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is performed and biopsies are taken of an erythematous area of the lower oesophageal mucosa 3cm above the gastro-oesophageal junction. There is no mass lesion, no ulceration and no haemorrhage noted. The biopsies demonstrate the presence of _columnar epithelium with goblet cells_. Which of the following mucosal alterations is most probably represented by these findings? 

    A. Metaplasia 
    B. Dysplasia 
    C. Hyperplasia 
    D. Carcinoma 
    E. Ischaemia

#### Answer: A. Metaplasia - TRUE

Metaplasia is the substitution of one tissue normally found at a site for another. It is a reversible change. Epithelial metaplasia is a two-edged sword and, in most circumstances, represents an undesirable change. Moreover, the influences that predispose to metaplasia, if persistent, may induce malignant transformation in metaplastic epithelium. Metaplasia from squamous to columnar type is seen in Barrett’s oesophagus, in which the oesophageal squamous epithelium is replaced by intestinal-like columnar cells under the influence of refluxed gastric acid. The epithelium undergoes metaplasia in response to the ongoing inflammation from reflux of gastric contents. It is common in the lower oesophagus with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Cancers may arise in these areas, and these are typically glandular (adeno)carcinomas.

The growth of the epithelial cells must become disordered in order to be dysplastic. Hyperplasia may occur with inflammation, as the number of cells increases, but hyperplasia does not explain the presence of the columnar cells. A carcinoma has the cellular atypia with hyperchromatism and pleomorphism. Goblet cells would not be seen. Ischaemia would be unusual at this site and would be marked by coagulative necrosis.


### Q3.30
A serum electrolyte analysis suggests hypernatraemia. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be associated with hypernatraemia? 

    A. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) - F
    B. Oedematous conditions 
    C. Patients on diuretic therapy 
    D. Patients on osmotic cathartics 
    E. Cases of water intoxication - F

#### Answer: C. Patients on diuretic therapy - *FALSE* = D. Patients on osmotic cathartics - TRUE

Hypernatraemia results from one of two basic mechanisms: water is lost and not adequately replaced or, less commonly, too much salt is taken in with insufficient water. Electrolyte-free water can be lost as pure water, with no accompanying electrolyte, or it can be lost in hypotonic fluids, which have lower electrolyte concentrations than plasma. Hypotonic losses can be thought of as mixtures of isotonic fluid and free water. Pure water and hypotonic fluid losses, the most common causes of hypernatraemia, are typically associated with a contracted extracellular fluid (ECF) volume. However, this is not always the case. When hypernatraemia is caused by a rapid intake of salt (acute salt poisoning), the extracellular volume expands because of water drawn from the intracellular space. In critically ill patients, extracellular volume expansion with oedema often coexists with hypernatraemia; the finding reflects free water losses in patients who become oedematous after fluid resuscitation for shock or underlying conditions such as congestive heart failure, renal disease and hepatic cirrhosis.

Faecal losses of water contain electrolytes at a concentration comparable to that of plasma, except when osmotic cathartics such as sorbitol or lactulose are given. These cathartic agents osmotically attract electrolyte-free water to the intestinal lumen, leading to hypotonic fluid losses. Oral sorbitol is a non-absorbable solute, given with sodium polystyrene sulphonate to treat hyperkalaemia or with charcoal to treat poisoning; the sorbitol osmotically attracts electrolyte-free water into the intestinal lumen, where it is eliminated in the stool. Similarly, lactulose, which is used to treat hepatic encephalopathy, can promote large electrolyte-free water losses, causing a high incidence of hypernatraemia unless the lost water is replaced.

### Q3.31
While playing football a 25-year-old man is kicked on the thigh by a player from the opposite team. The skin is not broken. Within 48 hours he notices a 6 × 8cm purple patch at the site of injury. Which of the following substances most likely has to accumulate at the site of injury to produce a _yellow-brown colour_ 2 weeks after the injury?

	A. Lipofuscin 
	B. Bilirubin
	C. Haemosiderin
	D. Melanin 
	E. Glycogen

#### Answer: A. Lipofuscin - *FALSE* = C. Haemosiderin - TRUE

Haemosiderin is a haemoglobin-derived, golden-yellow–brown, granular or crystalline pigment, in which form iron is stored in cells. Iron is normally carried by specific transport proteins – the transferrins. In cells, it is stored in association with a protein, apoferritin, to form ferritin micelles. Ferritin is a constituent of most cell types. When there is a local or systemic excess of iron, ferritin forms haemosiderin granules, which are easily seen with the light microscope. Thus, haemosiderin pigment represents aggregates of ferritin micelles. Under normal conditions, small amounts of haemosiderin can be seen in the mononuclear phagocytes of the bone marrow, spleen and liver, all actively engaged in red cell breakdown.

Excesses of iron cause haemosiderin to accumulate within cells, as either a localised process or a systemic derangement. Local excesses of iron and haemosiderin result from gross haemorrhages or the myriad minute haemorrhages that accompany severe vascular congestion. The best example of localised haemosiderosis is the common bruise. After local haemorrhage, the area is at first red–blue. With lysis of the erythrocytes, the haemoglobin eventually undergoes transformation to haemosiderin. Macrophages take part in this process by phagocytosing the red cell debris, and then lysosomal enzymes eventually convert the haemoglobin, through a sequence of pigments, into haemosiderin. The play of colours through which the bruise passes reflects these transformations. The original red–blue colour of haemoglobin is transformed to varying shades of green– blue, comprising the local formation of biliverdin (green bile), then bilirubin (red bile) and, thereafter, the iron moiety of haemoglobin is deposited as golden-yellow haemosiderin.

Lipofuchsin is a ‘wear-and-tear’ pigment that builds up in cells of tissues (such as the myocardium and liver) over many years. Melanin pigment darkens the skin as its concentrations increase from sunlight exposure (tanning). A generalised yellow colour, jaundice, can be the result of hyperbilirubinaemia. Glycogen is stored in striated muscle and liver and imparts no grossly visible colour change.


### Q3.32
Which of the following statements about special total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions is _contrary to the available scientific evidence_? 

	A. For patients in cardiac failure the TPN solution must be more concentrated - T
	B. Patients in renal failure who cannot be dialysed should be given a TPN solution without amino acids 
	C. Patients in hepatic encephalopathy should receive branched-chain amino acids 
	D. Hepatic failure patients should receive major calories in the form of intravenous glucose infusions - F
	E. Patients with respiratory failure may benefit from the replacement of some glucose energy intake with fat

#### Answer: D. Hepatic failure patients should receive major calories in the form of intravenous glucose infusions - *FALSE* = B. Patients in renal failure who cannot be dialysed should be given a TPN solution without amino acids - TRUE

The total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solution must be more concentrated for patients who require fluid restriction (eg those with pulmonary and cardiac failure). A litre of concentrated TPN solution usually contains a combination of 500ml D60W or D70W and 500ml of 10% or 15% amino acids plus additives. Patients in renal failure (serum creatinine >2mg/dl) who cannot be dialysed and require fluid restriction should receive a special renal failure TPN solution. Each litre of solution contains a combination of 500ml D60W or D70W and just 500ml essential amino acids plus limited amounts of sodium, potassium, magnesium and phosphate. Patients in renal failure who can undergo dialysis should receive a TPN solution that contains 500ml D60W or D70W and 500ml of 8.5% standard amino acids (a combination of essential and non-essential) plus additives, with limited amounts of sodium, potassium, magnesium and phosphate.

Hepatic encephalopathy has been related to the high levels of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan) in the plasma, acting as precursors of false neurotransmitters (amines) in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Administration of branched-chain amino acid solution (enriched with leucine, isoleucine and valine) will normalise the plasma aminogram and possibly reverse the coma in patients with chronic encephalopathy. Glucose should be used as a source of energy in hepatic failure but it needs careful monitoring. Blood levels may fluctuate widely because carbohydrate tolerance is impaired as a result of peripheral insulin resistance. Intravenous lipid infusions are contraindicated because they have a synergistic effect in producing coma, particularly with ammonia, and they may exacerbate coma by displacing tryptophan from plasma protein-binding sites. Administration of high doses of glucose to patients with borderline respiratory function may increase their carbon dioxide production to the point of compromising respiratory function. Such patients may benefit from the replacement of some glucose energy intake with fat. High rates of infusion of amino acids may increase respiratory drive in some patients; this may be important therapeutically.


### Q3.33
For which of the following conditions is _morphine the analgesic of choice_? 

	A. Head injuries 
	B. Acute myocardial infarction 
	C. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
	D. Addison’s disease 
	E. Liver disease

#### Answer: B. Acute myocardial infarction - TRUE

Morphine is contraindicated in patients with head injury as a result of its property of raising the intracranial pressure. A serious action is stoppage of respiratory exchange in emphysema or cor pulmonale. Hence, it is contraindicated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Patients with adrenal insufficiency or myxoedema may experience extended and increased effects from opioids. Morphine is mainly metabolised by the liver, hence it should be avoided in patients with liver disease. Morphine is the analgesic of choice for relieving pain associated with acute myocardial infarction.


### Q3.34
A patient presents to the Emergency Department with chemical burns involving his hands. Which of the following statements correctly describes the management of chemical burns? 

	A. Chemical burns are usually superficial burns 
	B. Chemical burns must not be washed with water 
	C. Chemical burns should be treated with neutralising agents because they completely remove the causative chemical agents 
	D. Chemical burns may be aggravated by the use of neutralising agents 
	E. Chemical burns never progress with time

#### Answer: D. Chemical burns may be aggravated by the use of neutralising agents - TRUE

The principal difference between thermal burns and chemical burns is that in chemical burns tissue destruction continues as long as contact is maintained, unless the agent is inactivated by its reaction with the tissues. This means that chemical burns are usually deeper than they initially appear and progress with time. The initial treatment of a chemical burn is dilution of the chemical with water. This is best delivered by continuous running water or by prolonged hydrotherapy in large volume tanks for 12 h. Neutralising agents should not be used because they cause exothermic reactions and increased tissue damage.


### Q3.35
You are managing a patient with bladder rupture in the Emergency Department. Which of the following statements about _bladder rupture_ is _contrary to the existing knowledge_ on the subject? 

	A. Bladder rupture occurs extraperitoneally as a result of perforations by adjacent bony fragments from the site of pelvic fracture 
	B. Bladder rupture, if extraperitoneal, may be treated with prolonged Foley catheter drainage 
	C. Bladder rupture is often a result of straddle injury 
	D. Bladder rupture is diagnosed by cystography 
	E. Bladder rupture in association with severe pelvic fractures and massive retroperitoneal bleeding is best managed conservatively

#### Answer: E. Bladder rupture in association with severe pelvic fractures and massive retroperitoneal bleeding is best managed conservatively - *FALSE* = C. Bladder rupture is often a result of straddle injury - TRUE

The bladder ruptures extraperitoneally as a result of perforations by adjacent bony fragments from the site of pelvic fracture. Disruption of the urethra is often a result of straddle injury. A delayed repair of the extraperitoneal rupture may be required once the retroperitoneal bleeding has been controlled and the condition of the patient stabilised. These patients are at very high risk of haemorrhagic complications associated with dissection into the retroperitoneal pelvic haematoma.


### Q3.36
Which of the following statements about diagnosis and management of pancreatic trauma is correct? 

	A. Signs of peritonitis develop early after blunt pancreatic trauma - F
	B. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is the investigation of choice for pancreatic trauma - F
	C. Hyperamylasaemia is an indicator of pancreatic trauma 
	D. Ductal transection in the body of the pancreas is an indication for Whipple’s procedure - F
	E. Pancreatic fistulae originating from the parenchyma exclusive of the main duct in the body or head never close spontaneously - F

#### Answer: C. Hyperamylasaemia is an indicator of pancreatic trauma - TRUE

The retroperitoneal location of the pancreas precludes the early development of peritonitis. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage will not be helpful except in the most extensive injury where there is transudation of retroperitoneal blood in the peritoneal cavity. Computed tomography (CT) is an excellent technique for evaluation of patients with suspected injuries to the pancreas. A progressive rise in the amylase over the first 24–48 h of hospitalisation is strongly suggestive of injury to either the pancreas or the duodenum. Ductal transection in the neck, body or tail is an indication of distal pancreatectomy or roux-en-Y distal pancreatojejunostomy. Pancreatic fistulae originating exclusively from the parenchyma exclusively of the main duct in the body or head will usually close spontaneously.


### Q3.37
A 25-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of _hepatic trauma_. Which of the following features will prompt the consultant to opt for an _immediate operation_? 

	A. Intrahepatic haematoma seen on computed tomography (CT) that is non-expanding 
	B. No evidence of active bleeding 
	C. A non-bleeding laceration of the liver seen on CT with associated splenic trauma 
	D. A laceration <3cm in parenchymal depth 
	E. A subcapsular haematoma involving 10–50% surface area

#### Answer: C. A non-bleeding laceration of the liver seen on CT with associated splenic trauma - TRUE

Non-surgical management of stable patients with hepatic injuries diagnosed on CT is now practised in many centres. CT criteria for non-operative management include the following:

1. Simple hepatic parenchymal laceration or intrahepatic haematomas
2. No evidence of active bleeding
3. Intraperitoneal blood loss < 250 mL
4. An absence of other intraperitoneal injuries requiring operation.

Associated splenic trauma is an indication for surgical intervention.


### Q3.38
After blunt abdominal trauma diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is indicated: 
    
    A. In a patient with an altered sensorium from a head injury 
	B. In a patient with a previous midline laparotomy scar 
	C. In a patient with significant haematoma of the abdominal wall related to pelvic fracture 
	D. In the latter stages of pregnancy 
	E. In a patient with morbid obesity

#### Answer: C. In a patient with significant haematoma of the abdominal wall related to pelvic fracture - *FALSE * = A. In a patient with an altered sensorium from a head injury

Since the first descriptions of diagnostic peritoneal lavage/tap (DPL) by Root and colleagues in the mid-1960s, this technique has remained a mainstay of the evaluation of the patient with possible intra-abdominal injuries after blunt trauma. Patients in whom this technique should be considered are listed as follows:

1. A patient with an altered sensorium from a head injury, drug ingestion or alcohol intoxication.
2. A patient with altered sensation such as from a spinal cord injury.
3. A patient with injury to adjacent structures such as the ribs or transverse processes of the vertebrae.
4. The patient with equivocal findings on physical examination of the abdomen.
 
The absolute contraindication to the technique is an obvious indication for laparotomy. Relative contraindications include scars on the abdominal wall reflecting previous intra-abdominal operations, the latter stages of pregnancy, morbid obesity, a coagulopathy and significant haematomas of the abdominal wall related to pelvic fractures.


### Q3.39
Which of the following changes is _most likely_ to be seen _after major trauma_? 

	A. There is profound insulin hypersensitivity 
	B. Marked vasoconstriction occurs in vessels that perfuse injured areas during the hyperdynamic phase 
	C. Peripheral resistance increases 
	D. Control of wound circulation is different to other critical tissues 
	E. The liver is the origin of the nitrogen loss in the urine 

#### Answer: C. Peripheral resistance increases - TRUE

In addition to the profound glucose flow, there is profound insulin insensitivity. These effects do not occur because of inadequate quantities of insulin released from the endocrine pancreas, because in most cases there is hyperinsulinaemia. However, the cause for the marked insulin resistance is related to diminished food intake and an altered hormonal environment – the counterregulatory hormones glucagon, cortisol and catecholamines – that exert anti-insulin activity. In the initial phase of injury, blood volume is reduced, peripheral resistance increases and cardiac output falls. Marked vasodilatation occurs in vessels that perfuse injured areas and this is accompanied by the ingrowth of new capillaries. Control of wound circulation is similar to other critical tissues (heart, brain, working skeletal muscle), in which blood flow varies as a function of local metabolic conditions rather than being part of integrated central vasoregulatory reflexes. This means that, as long as blood pressure is maintained, wound perfusion is ensured. Muscle is the origin of the nitrogen loss in the urine after extensive injury. However, it has been recognised that the composition of amino acid efflux from skeletal muscle does not reflect the composition of muscle protein. Alanine and glutamine constitute the majority of amino acids released, whereas each makes up only about 6% of muscle protein.


### Q3.40
Which of the following statements correctly describes the approach to a patient with _trauma to the neck_? 

	A. A radiograph of the neck is a particularly useful diagnostic tool for suspected laryngeal fracture or penetrating laryngeal injury 
	B. Zone I or thoracic inlet injuries must be investigated with panendoscopy and early arteriography 
	C. Zone II injuries are injuries to the upper neck 
	D. Zone III injuries must be immediately explored without any preliminary investigations 
	E. Zone III extends from the clavicular heads to the angles of the jaw

#### Answer: E. Zone III extends from the clavicular heads to the angles of the jaw - *FALSE* = B. Zone I or thoracic inlet injuries must be investigated with panendoscopy and early arteriography - TRUE

Zone I injuries occur at the base of the neck and do not allow easy accessibility from an operative standpoint. Injuries in zone I may involve proximal carotid, subclavian or innominate vessels, and patients are at risk of exsanguinating haemorrhage, which may be occult if the blood tracks into the chest or mediastinum. Thoracic inlet injuries must therefore be investigated with panendoscopy and arteriography. Zone II injuries are midneck injuries (from the clavicular heads to angles of the jaw). Injuries that occur above the angle of the mandible (zone III) may involve the petrous or cavernous portions of the internal carotid artery, the vertebral artery or deep branches of the external carotid artery. Wide exposure of this area and distal vascular control may be difficult to obtain.

Routine exploration as a diagnostic manoeuvre may be both hazardous and inaccurate. Gunshot wounds account for most of these injuries, and patients may present with haematoma or haemorrhage from the mouth, nose, throat or wound. There are often associated neurological injuries. Arteriography is the diagnostic method of choice for zone III injuries. It has proved highly sensitive and specific, and a negative study obviates the need for vascular exploration. Moreover, therapeutic embolisation may be indicated for inaccessible branches of the external carotid artery, the vertebral artery or a thrombosed internal carotid in a comatose patient. Zone III or upper neck injuries (above the angle of the jaw) prompt arteriography before any needed exploration. CT is a particularly useful diagnostic tool for suspected laryngeal fracture or penetrating laryngeal injury.


Questions 3.41-3.50

8/10 = 80% - F: 43, 48

### Q3.41
A 56-year-old man with past history of heavy alcohol consumption has been treated in the hospital for pancreatitis for the past 3 weeks. He is examined one morning on rounds and found to have a swollen right leg. It is _tender to palpation_ posteriorly but is _not warm_. This condition is most likely to be the result of which of the following pathological processes? 

	A. Septic embolisation 
	B. Congestive heart failure 
	C. Venous thrombosis 
	D. Cellulitis 
	E. Infarction

#### Answer: C. Venous thrombosis - TRUE

### Q3.42
An 80-year-old woman was hospitalised after a fall from steps that resulted in fracture of the neck of the femur on the right side. After surgery to replace the broken hip she was bedridden and was unable to ambulate until about a month later, when she died suddenly. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be the immediate cause of her death? 

	A. Carcinoma of the uterus 
	B. Tuberculosis (TB) 
	C. Pneumococcal pneumonia 
	D. Pulmonary embolism 
	E. Congestive heart failure (CHD)

#### Answer: D. Pulmonary embolism - TRUE

### Q3.43
A 25-year-old man is involved in a motor vehicle accident that results in a compound fracture of the left femur, along with blunt abdominal trauma. In the Emergency Department he is noted to have cool, pallid skin. He has vital signs showing: temperature 36.7°c, pulse 103/min, respiratory rate 18/min and blood pressure (BP) 70/30mmHg. He has decreased urine output. Which of the following laboratory findings on a blood sample from this patient is most likely to be present? 

	A. Haematocrit of 42% 
	B. Glucose of 40 mg/dl 
	C. PAO2 of 2.7kPa (20 mmHg) 
	D. Troponin l of 4 ng/ml 
	E. Lactic acid of 4.8 mmol/L

#### Answer: D. Troponin l of 4 ng/ml - *FALSE* = E. Lactic acid of 4.8 mmol/L - TRUE

### Q3.44
A 25-year-old man suffered a traumatic blow to his right forearm while playing football. He was referred to an orthopaedics outpatient clinic after he continued to have pain and tenderness 3 months later. A plain film radiograph revealed a 4cm circumscribed mass in the soft tissue adjacent to the radius. The mass contained areas of brightness on the radiograph. The consultant reassured him that it was nothing sinister. Over the next year this process gradually resolved. Which of the following terms best describes this process? 

	A. Dysplasia 
	B. Metaplasia 
	C. Hyperplasia 
	D. Hypertrophy 
	E. Neoplasia

#### Answer: B. Metaplasia - TRUE

The brightness on the radiograph suggests calcification from the osseous metaplasia that developed in the healing process. This condition is known as myositis ossificans, because there is bone formation in the injured muscle. Connective tissue metaplasia is the formation of cartilage, bone or adipose tissue (mesenchymal tissues) in tissues that normally do not contain these elements. This type of metaplasia is less clearly seen as an adaptive response.

Dysplasia refers to disordered epithelial cell growth. There are increased numbers of cells in this exaggerated healing process, but this does not account for the bright calcification. Although some cells may increase in size, the process is one of bone formation – metaplastic bone formation as part of an exaggerated healing process, not the uncontrolled growth of a neoplasm.


### Q3.45
A young patient is diagnosed with a neurofibroma. Which of the following statements best describes neurofibroma? 

	A. A neurofibroma arises from the connective tissue of the nerve sheath 
	B. A neurofibroma presents as a smooth, firm, ‘painful subcutaneous nodule’ which can be moved along the line of the nerve from which it arises 
	C. A neurofibroma can be easily removed from the nerve from which it arises 
	D. Plexiform neurofibromatosis is a rare condition characterised by multiple malignant neurofibromas 
	E. A neurofibroma along with pigmentation

#### Answer: A. A neurofibroma arises from the connective tissue of the nerve sheath - TRUE

Neurofibroma arises from the connective tissue of the nerve sheath. The ‘painful’ subcutaneous nodule forms a smooth firm swelling that may be moved in a lateral direction, but is otherwise fixed by the nerve from which it arises. As the nerve fibres are ‘part and parcel’ of the tumour, they are difficult to remove without the removal of the nerve itself. In major nerves recurrence is a problem, as is malignant (sarcomatous) change. Plexiform neurofibromatosis is a rare condition characterised by enormous thickening of the affected nerve as a result of myxofibromatous degeneration of the endoneurium. This rare condition usually occurs in connection with branches of the fifth cranial nerve, although it may occur in the extremities. Von Recklinghausen’s disease of the nerves is an autosomal dominant disease in which any cranial, spinal or peripheral nerve may be diffusely or nodularly thickened. Associated pigmentation is common.


### Q3.46
Which of the following statements about spread of malignant tumours is correct? 

	A. Permeation means that cancer cells that invade a lymphatic vessel can break away and be carried by lymph circulation to a regional node 
	B. Malignant melanoma spreads by permeation alone 
	C. 'Kiss cancer' of the labium majus is an example of spread of malignant tumours by implantation 
	D. Krukenberg’s tumour is an example of haematogenous spread 
	E. Rodent ulcer spreads via the lymphatics

#### Answer: C. 'Kiss cancer' of the labium majus is an example of spread of malignant tumours by implantation - TRUE

In permeation the malignant cells grow along the lymphatic vessels from the primary growth. This may occur even in a retrograde direction. The cancer cells stimulate perilymphatic fibrosis, but this does not stop the advance of the disease. In some instances, notably malignant melanoma, groups of cells may so overcome the surrounding fibrosis that they give rise to intermediate deposits between the primary growth and the lymph nodes. Malignant melanoma spreads by permeation as well as embolism. In embolism cancer cells that invade a lymphatic vessel can break away and are carried by the lymph circulation to a regional node, so that nodes comparatively distant from the tumour may be involved in the early stages. Another example, of ‘kiss cancer’, is carcinoma of the lower lip affecting the upper. For the abdomen, transcoelomic spread is especially notable when cells from a colloid carcinoma of the stomach gravitate on to an active ovary and give rise to malignant ovarian tumours (Krukenberg’s tumour). A rodent ulcer (synonymous with basal cell carcinoma) is a locally malignant tumour; distant metastasis via the lymphatics or haematogenous spread is virtually non-existent.


### Q3.47
A 36-year-old woman presents with a _trophic ulcer_ over the ball of the big toe of her left foot. Which of the following conditions is least likely to be diagnosed in this patient? 

	A. Chronic vasospasm 
	B. Syringomyelia 
	C. Diabetes 
	D. Spina bifida 
	E. Tuberculosis (TB)

#### Answer: E. Tuberculosis (TB) - TRUE

Trophic ulcers (trophe, Greek for nutrition) are caused by an impairment of the nutrition of the tissues, which depends on an adequate blood supply and also a properly functioning nerve supply. Ischaemia and anaesthesia will therefore cause these ulcers. Thus, in the arm, chronic vasospasm and syringomyelia will cause ulceration of the tips of the fingers (respectively painful and painless). In the leg, painful ischaemic ulcers occur around the ankle or on the dorsum of the foot. Neuropathic ulcers caused by anaesthesia (diabetic neuritis, spina bifida, tabes dorsalis, leprosy or a peripheral nerve injury) are often called perforating ulcers. Starting in a corn or bunion, they penetrate the foot, and suppuration may involve the bones and joints and spread along fascial planes upwards, even involving the calf.


### Q3.48
A 53-year-old woman with a history of full-thickness burn involving her right forearm presented in a surgical outpatient clinic with a _Marjolin’s ulcer_. Which of the following statements best describes a Marjolin’s ulcer? 

	A. It is a sarcoma that develops in a scar 
	B. It grows rapidly
	C. It is painless 
	D. It is usually associated with secondary deposits in the regional lymph nodes 
	E. It is due to localized areas of fat necrosis.

#### Answer: A. It is a sarcoma that develops in a scar - *FALSE* = C. It is painless - TRUE

Marjolin’s ulcer is a carcinoma that develops in a scar. Chronic wounds and scar tissues are prone to an increased risk of skin cancer. In 1828, Jean-Nicholas Marjolin described the occurrence of tumours in post-traumatic scar tissue. Marjolin’s ulcer most frequently occurs in old burn scars, but it has also been reported in relation to osteomyelitis, frostbite, venous stasis ulcers, skin graft donor sites, chronic decubitus ulcers, gunshot wounds, puncture wounds, dog bites, occult trauma, injection sites and scar tissue around colostomies. In adults the usual time for the appearance of carcinoma in scar tissue is around the age of 53–59 years. As a general rule, the latency period between the burn injury and the appearance of cancer is 25–40 years. It grows slowly, because the scar is relatively avascular. It is painless because the tissue contains no nerves. Secondary deposits do not occur in the regional lymph nodes because lymphatic vessels have been destroyed. If the ulcer invades normal tissue surrounding the scar, it extends at a normal rate, and lymph nodes are then liable to be involved.


### Q3.49
A 22-year-old man who had previously undergone laparotomy for removal of a malignant growth involving the small bowel has now got a persistent sinus in his midline laparotomy scar. Which of the following conditions is least likely to be associated with persistence of a sinus? 

	A. Presence of a foreign body or necrotic tissue 
	B. Inefficient or non-dependent drainage 
	C. Unrelieved obstruction of the lumen of a viscus 
	D. Excess vitamin c intake 
	E. Irradiation

#### Answer: D. Excess vitamin c intake  - TRUE

Persistence of a sinus or fistula is the result of one of the following:

- A foreign body or necrotic tissue is present, eg a suture, hairs, a sequestrum, a faecolith or even a worm (as in guinea-worm infestation)
- Inefficient or non-dependent drainage: a long, narrow, tortuous track predisposes to inefficient drainage
- Unrelieved obstruction of the lumen of a viscus or tube distal to the fistula
- Absence of rest, such as occurs in fistula in ano, caused by the normal contractions of the sphincter that also force faecal matter into the internal opening
- The walls have become lined with epithelium or endothelium (arteriovenous fistula)
- Dense fibrosis prevents contraction and healing
- Type of infection, e.g. TB or actinomycosis
- The presence of malignant disease
- Persistent discharge, such as urine, faeces or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
- Ischaemia
- Drugs, e.g. steroids
- Malnutrition
- Interference, e.g. artefacts
- Irradiation, e.g. rectovaginal fistula after treatment for carcinoma of the cervix


### Q3.50
A child is diagnosed with _xeroderma pigmentosum_. Which of the following statements best describes this disorder? 

	A. Xeroderma pigmentosum is associated with increased incidence of bladder cancer 
	B. Xeroderma pigmentosum is characterised by defective DNA repair 
	C. Xeroderma pigmentosum leads to failure of antigen presentation by langerhans’ cells of the skin 
	D. Xeroderma pigmentosum is a sex-linked disorder 
	E. Xeroderma pigmentosum-associated tumours are caused by reverse transcriptase-mediated copying of the viral RNA genome


#### Answer: B. Xeroderma pigmentosum is characterised by defective DNA repair - TRUE

Xeroderma pigmentosum is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by failure of DNA-repair mechanisms. There is a markedly increased incidence of skin cancers in xeroderma pigmentosum. Ultraviolet light is thought to enhance neoplastic change in the skin by dimer formation between neighbouring thymine pairs in DNA. These deleterious changes in DNA are repaired by enzymatically mediated mechanisms. In xeroderma pigmentosum, specific enzyme deficiencies result in failure of such repair and a consequent increase in the tumorigenic effect of sunlight.

5/10 = 50% - F: 51, 53, 54, 55, 56

### Q3.51
A 28-year-old man of south Asian origin has had a chronic cough with fever for 2 months. On physical examination his temperature is 37.9°c. A chest radiograph reveals a diffuse bilateral reticulonodular pattern. A transbronchial biopsy is performed. On microscopic examination of the biopsy there are focal areas of inflammation containing _epithelioid macrophages_, _Langhans’ giant cells_ and _lymphocytes_. These findings are most typical for which of the following immunological responses? 

	A. Type IV hypersensitivity 
	B. Type I hypersensitivity 
	C. Type II hypersensitivity
	D. Graft-versus-host disease 
	E. Polyclonal B-cell activation

#### Answer: E. Polyclonal B-cell activation - *FALSE* = A. Type IV hypersensitivity - TRUE

Granuloma formation with TB is a classic type IV hypersensitivity reaction. The cell-mediated type of hypersensitivity is initiated by antigen-activated (sensitised) T lymphocytes. It includes the delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions mediated by CD4+ T cells, and direct cell cytotoxicity mediated by CD8+ T cells. It is the principal pattern of immunological response not only to a variety of intracellular microbiological agents, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but also to many viruses, fungi, protozoa and parasites. So-called contact skin sensitivity to chemical agents and graft rejection are other instances of cell-mediated reactions. In addition, many autoimmune diseases are now known to be caused by T-cell-mediated reactions.

Type I reactions are associated with allergy and anaphylaxis. Type II reactions are associated with complement-mediated immune reactions. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) does not produce a granulomatous reaction. Granulomatous reactions are based mainly on cell-mediated immunity.


### Q3.52
A 22-year-old man with previous history of corrective cardiac surgery in infancy is given intravenous penicillin to treat infective endocarditis. Within minutes of starting this therapy, he begins to have severe difficulty breathing with respiratory stridor and tachypnoea. He suddenly develops an erythematous skin rash over most of his body. His symptoms are most likely to be produced by release of which of the following chemical mediators? 

	A. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) 
	B. Histamine 
	C. Bradykinin 
	D. Complement C5a 
	E. Thromboxane

#### Answer: B. Histamine - TRUE

This is a type I hypersensitivity reaction with systemic anaphylaxis, in part mediated by the most important vasoactive amine – histamine. About 20% of people will have some reaction to penicillin or similar drugs, and a few of these will be severe. Histamine causes intense smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability, and increased secretion by nasal, bronchial and gastric glands.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is more involved with the appearance of fever with inflammation. Bradykinin mediates the appearance of pain and vascular permeability. Complement C5a is a chemotactic factor. Thromboxane, generated by the cyclo-oxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, mediates platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction to promote haemostasis.


### Q3.53
After suturing of surgical wounds a substance, produced by macrophages, is found at the wound site which stimulates capillary proliferation during the first week. Which of the following substances is _most likely_ to have this function? 

	A. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
	B. Phospholipase c 
	C. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 
	D. Fibronectin 
	E. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)

#### Answer: A. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) - *FALSE* = C. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) - TRUE

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) can stimulate all aspects of angiogenesis. This is a family of growth factors containing more than ten members, of which acidic FGF (aFGF, or FGF-1) and basic FGF (bFGF, or FGF-2) are the best characterised. FGF-1 and FGF-2 are made by a variety of cells. Released FGFs associate with heparan sulphate in the extracellular matrix, which can serve as a reservoir for storing inactive factors. FGFs are recognised by a family of cell-surface receptors that have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. A large number of functions are attributed to FGFs, including the following:

- New blood vessel formation (angiogenesis): FGF-2, in particular, has the ability to induce the steps necessary for new blood vessel formation both in vivo and in vitro (see below).
- Wound repair: FGFs participate in macrophage, fibroblast and endothelial cell migration in damaged tissues and migration of epithelium to form new epidermis.
- Development: FGFs play a role in skeletal muscle development and lung maturation, eg FGF-6 and its receptor induce myoblast proliferation and suppress myocyte differentiation, providing a supply of proliferating myocytes. FGF-2 is also thought to be involved in the generation of angioblasts during embryogenesis. FGF-1 and FGF-2 are involved in the specification of the liver from endodermal cells.
- Haematopoiesis: FGFs have been implicated in the differentiation of specific lineages of blood cells and development of bone marrow stroma.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) released from macrophages as well as activated platelets can stimulate fibroblast growth for collagen synthesis. Phospholipases aid in stimulation of intracellular protein kinases, which promote protein phosphorylation. Fibronectin is a component of the extracellular matrix that helps to link cells together. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a stimulator of cell growth through activation of tyrosine kinases in the cells; it can also stimulate angiogenesis to a degree.


### Q3.54
After a laparotomy almost all of the tensile strength that can be obtained in wound healing in the skin will most probably be achieved within which of the following time periods? 

	A. One week 
	B. One month 
	C. Three months 
	D. Six months 
	E. One year

#### Answer: D. Six months - *FALSE* = C. Three months - TRUE

At 3 months about 70–80% of the tensile strength of non-wounded skin is reached, which is about as much as will be obtained. After 3 months, there will be little gain in tensile strength. When the sutures are removed, usually at the end of the first week, wound strength is about 10% that of unwounded skin, but strength increases rapidly over the next 4 weeks. This rate of increase then slows at approximately the third month after the original incision, and reaches a plateau at about 70–80% of the tensile strength of unwounded skin, a condition that may persist for life. The recovery of tensile strength results from the excess of collagen synthesis over collagen degradation during the first 2 months of healing, and, at later times, from structural modifications of collagen fibres (cross-linking, increased fibre size) after collagen synthesis ceases. At 1 week the wound site has granulation tissue, but little collagen at this point. At 1 month collagen is being laid down, but a plateau phase has not been reached.


### Q3.55
A 20-year-old man had his thymus removed through a median sternotomy. Two months later there is a firm, 4 × 3cm nodular mass with intact overlying epithelium in the region of the incision. On examination the scar is firm, but not tender, with no erythema. This mass is excised and microscopically shows fibroblasts with abundant collagen. Which of the following mechanisms has most probably produced this series of events? 

	A. Development of a fibrosarcoma 
	B. Poor wound healing 
	C. Keloid formation 
	D. Foreign body response from suturing 
	E. Staphylococcal wound infection

#### Answer: B. Poor wound healing - *FALSE* = C. Keloid formation - TRUE

Some people have an inappropriate wound healing response with excessive collagenisation. Excessive formation of the components of the repair process can also complicate wound healing. Aberrations of growth may occur even in what may begin initially as normal wound healing. The accumulation of excessive amounts of collagen may give rise to a raised scar known as a hypertrophic scar; if the scar tissue grows beyond the boundaries of the original wound and does not regress, it is called a keloid. Keloid formation appears to be an individual predisposition, and for unknown reasons this aberration is somewhat more common in African–American individuals. The mechanisms of keloid formation are still unknown. Another deviation in wound healing is the formation of excessive amounts of granulation tissue, which protrudes above the level of the surrounding skin and blocks re-epithelialisation. This has been called exuberant granulation (or, with more literary fervour, proud flesh). Excessive granulation must be removed by cautery or surgical excision to permit restoration of the continuity of the epithelium. Finally (fortunately rarely), incisional scars or traumatic injuries may be followed by exuberant proliferation of fibroblasts and other connective tissue elements that may, in fact, recur after excision. Called desmoids, or aggressive fibromatoses, these lie in the interface between benign proliferations and malignant (although low-grade) tumours.

The wound will not have excessive collagen with poor wound healing. Sutures can produce small foreign body granulomata that typically are not visible. Trauma does not lead to neoplasia, so fibrosarcoma is the least likely to be seen in this case. A wound infection will produce dehiscence and abscess formation that delays or disrupts collagenisation.


### Q3.56
A 52-year-old woman was investigated for vague abdominal discomfort of 4 months’ duration. Her clinical examination was negative for lymphadenopathy, abdominal masses or organomegaly. Bowel sounds were audible. A stool specimen tested for occult blood was negative. Abdominal CT showed a 20cm retroperitoneal soft tissue mass obscuring the left psoas muscle. Which of the following neoplasms is this woman most likely to have? 

	A. Melanoma 
	B. Liposarcoma 
	C. Hamartoma 
	D. Adenocarcinoma 
	E. Lymphoma

#### Answer: E. Lymphoma - *FALSE* = B. Liposarcoma - TRUE

Liposarcomas are one of the most common sarcomas of adulthood and appear in those in their 40s to 60s; they are uncommon in children. They usually arise in the deep soft tissues of the proximal extremities and retroperitoneum and are notorious for developing into large tumours. Histologically, liposarcomas can be divided into well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell and pleomorphic variants. The well-differentiated variant is relatively indolent, the myxoid type is intermediate in its malignant behaviour, and the round cell and pleomorphic variants are usually aggressive and frequently metastasise. All types of liposarcoma recur locally and often repeatedly unless adequately excised.

Melanomas arise on the skin in most cases and are rarely visceral or in soft tissue. A hamartoma is a peculiar small benign neoplasm composed of tissues normal to a site, but just in a jumbled mass. A pulmonary hamartoma is the most common of these. Adenocarcinomas do not arise in soft tissues. Sarcomas arise in soft tissues. Finally, it is unlikely that matted nodes with lymphoma would reach this size.


### Q3.57
A fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is performed of a 2cm firm mass in the right breast of a 45-year-old woman. On microscopic examination a ductal carcinoma is seen. A poorer prognosis for the patient is most closely associated with which of the following findings? 

	A. Positive immunohistochemical staining for oestrogen receptors 
	B. A well-differentiated histological appearance 
	C. Intraductal growth pattern 
	D. Stage T1 N0 M0 
	E. Aneuploidy by flow cytometry

#### Answer: E. Aneuploidy by flow cytometry - TRUE

The outcome for women with breast cancer varies widely. Some women have the same life expectancy as women without breast cancer. Other women have only a 13% chance of being alive in 5 years. Except for the few women (<10%) with distant metastases at presentation or with inflammatory carcinoma, prognosis is determined by the pathological examination of the primary carcinoma and the axillary lymph nodes. This information is important for counselling patients about the likely outcome of their disease, choosing appropriate treatment and accurately classifying groups of similar patients for clinical trials. Aneuploidy is a bad prognostic sign because such neoplastic cells tend to be much less differentiated and much more aggressive.

The presence of oestrogen receptors suggests better differentiation and the possibility of treatment with hormonal agents. Well-differentiated tumours usually have a better prognosis. Intraductal growth suggests that this carcinoma remains in situ; infiltration indicates a more aggressive behaviour. The stage T1 N0 M0 is the lowest possible stage for any tumour. Neoplasms with a low stage tend to be less aggressive and have a better prognosis.


### Q3.58
A 45-year-old woman has had increasing cold intolerance, weight gain of 5kg and sluggishness over the past 2 years. A physical examination reveals dry, coarse skin and alopecia of the scalp. Her thyroid is not palpably enlarged. Her serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is 11.7 mU/L with thyroxine (T4) of 2.1g/dl. A year ago, _anti-thyroglobulin_ and _anti-microsomal autoantibodies_ (AMA) were detected at high titre. Which of the following thyroid diseases is she most likely to have? 

	A. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis 
	B. DeQuervain’s disease 
	C. Papillary carcinoma 
	D. Medullary thyroid carcinoma 
	E. Graves’ disease

#### Answer: A. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis - TRUE

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in areas of the world where iodine levels are sufficient. It is characterised by gradual thyroid failure because of autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland. The name Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is derived from the 1912 report by Hashimoto describing patients with goitre and intense lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid (struma lymphomatosa). This disorder is most prevalent at the ages between 45 and 65 years and is more common in women than in men, with a female predominance of 10–20:1. Although it is primarily a disease of older women, it can occur in children and is a major cause of non-endemic goitre in children.

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system reacts against a variety of thyroid antigens. The overriding feature of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is progressive depletion of thyroid epithelial cells (thyrocytes), which are gradually replaced by mononuclear cell infiltration and fibrosis. Multiple immunological mechanisms may contribute to the death of thyrocytes. Sensitisation of autoreactive CD4+ T-helper cells to thyroid antigens appears to be the initiating event. Anti-thyroid autoantibodies are helpful in establishing the diagnosis.

Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (DeQuervain’s disease) leads to transient thyroid enlargement with pain, but the course runs for a month or two and patients typically do not become hypothyroid. Carcinomas of the thyroid are not typically associated with autoantibodies. Medullary carcinomas are characterised by secretion of calcitonin and usually seen as a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). Graves’ disease produces hyperthyroidism and thyroid enlargement. Removal of the thyroid as a treatment can lead to hypothyroidism.


### Q3.59
An 82-year-old woman with no major medical problems is evaluated in the Emergency Department after a fall with a painful left hip and an inability to ambulate. Radiographs show not only a _fracture of the left femoral head_, but also a _compressed fracture of the T10 vertebra_. Which of the following conditions is she most likely to have? 

	A. Acute osteomyelitis 
	B. Osteogenesis imperfecta 
	C. Osteoporosis 
	D. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia 
	E. Metastatic breast carcinoma

#### Answer: C. Osteoporosis - TRUE

She most probably has osteoporosis with accelerated bone loss, leading to the propensity for fractures. Physical inactivity further accelerates bone loss and decreases muscle mass and agility, which contributes to falls. Osteoporosis is a disease characterised by increased porosity of the skeleton as a result of reduced bone mass. The associated structural changes predispose the bone to fracture. The disorder may be localised to a certain bone or region, as in disuse osteoporosis of a limb, or involve the entire skeleton, as a manifestation of a metabolic bone disease. Generalised osteoporosis may be primary or secondary to a large variety of conditions. The most common forms of osteoporosis are senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis. In these disorders, the critical loss of bone mass makes the skeleton vulnerable to fractures.
An osteomyelitis is not typical at this age and does not usually present as fractures in multiple locations. Osteogenesis imperfecta, an inherited disorder of collagen synthesis, is initially diagnosed in fetuses and young children. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is a rare disorder that can be seen with Mccune–Albright syndrome. A so-called ‘pathological fracture’ can occur from weakening of the bone by metastases, but such patients are often very ill, with a history of weight loss and prior bone pain.


### Q3.60
A 14-year-old girl complains of pain persisting in her right leg for 4 weeks. On physical examination her temperature is 37.9°C. A radiograph of the leg reveals a _mass in the diaphyseal region_ of the left femur with overlying cortical erosion and soft tissue extension. A bone biopsy is performed and the lesion shows _numerous small round blue cells_ on microscopic examination. 

Which of the following neoplasms is she most likely to have? 

	A. Medulloblastoma 
	B. Neuroblastoma 
	C. Chondroblastoma 
	D. Osteoblastoma 
	E. Ewing’s sarcoma

#### Answer: E. Ewing’s sarcoma - TRUE

A 'small round blue cell' tumour of bone is Ewing’s sarcoma, commonly seen at this age. Ewing’s sarcoma accounts for approximately 6–10% of primary malignant bone tumours and follows osteosarcoma as the second most common group of bone sarcomas in children. Of all bone sarcomas, Ewing’s sarcoma has the youngest average age at presentation, because most patients are 10–15 years old, and about 80% are younger than 20 years. Boys are affected slightly more frequently than girls, and there is a striking predilection for white individuals; black individuals are rarely afflicted. In about 85% of Ewing’s sarcomas, there is a t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation; in 5–10% of cases, the translocation is t(21;21)(q21;q12), and in less than 1% of tumours a t(7;22)(q22;12) translocation is present.

Arising in the medullary cavity, Ewing’s sarcoma usually invades the cortex and periosteum, producing a soft-tissue mass. The tumour is tan-white and frequently contains areas of haemorrhage and necrosis. It is composed of sheets of uniform, small, round cells that are slightly larger than lymphocytes. Ewing’s sarcoma usually arises in the diaphyses of long tubular bones, especially the femur and the flat bones of the pelvis. They present as painful enlarging masses, and the affected site is frequently tender, warm and swollen. Some patients have systemic findings, including fever, elevated sedimentation rate, anaemia and leukocytosis, which mimic infection. Plain radiographs show a destructive lytic tumour that has permeative margins and extension into the surrounding soft tissues. The characteristic periosteal reaction produces layers of reactive bone deposited in an onion-skin fashion.

Medulloblastoma, although composed of small blue cells, arises in the CNS (posterior fossa) in children. Although a neuroblastoma is composed of small blue cells, it typically arises in the adrenals in children. A chondroblastoma arises in the epiphysis of bone. An osteoblastoma is essentially just a large osteoid osteoma, often in vertebrae.

### Q3.61
A 19-year-old boy who is a rugby player has noted pain in his right knee after each practice session for the past 2 months. On examination there is tenderness to palpation of his right knee, with reduced range of motion. A plain film of the right leg reveals a mass of the _proximal tibial metaphysis_ that erodes the bone cortex, _lifting up the periosteum_ where reactive new bone is apparent. The mass does not extend into the epiphyseal region. A bone biopsy is performed and microscopic examination shows _atypical, elongated cells_ with _hyperchromatic nuclei_ in an _osteoid stroma_. Which of the following neoplasms is he most likely to have? 

	A. Metastatic seminoma 
	B. Ewing’s sarcoma - F
	C. Chondrosarcoma 
	D. Osteosarcoma 
	E. Multiple myeloma - F

#### Answer: C. Chondrosarcoma - *FALSE* = D. Osteosarcoma - TRUE

Osteoid production is characteristic for osteosarcoma, which is defined as a malignant mesenchymal tumour in which the cancerous cells produce bone matrix. It is the most common primary malignant tumour of bone, exclusive of myeloma and lymphoma, and accounts for about 20% of primary bone cancers. Osteosarcoma occurs in all age groups but has a bimodal age distribution; 75% occur in patients younger than 20. The smaller second peak occurs in elderly people, who frequently suffer from conditions known to be associated with the development of osteosarcoma – Paget’s disease, bone infarcts and prior irradiation. Overall, men are more commonly affected than women (1.6:1). The tumours usually arise in the metaphyseal region of the long bones of the extremities, and almost 60% occur around the knee. Any bone may be involved, however, and in those aged over 25 the incidence in flat bones and long bones is almost equal.

Metastases are unlikely to occur at this age. Overall, metastases are the most common malignancy involving bone. Primary bone tumours are not common. Ewing’s sarcoma has a peak incidence at a younger age, and most often involves the diaphyseal region. It does not produce osteoid. Chondrosarcomas do not make osteoid. They can occur over a wide age range. Myelomas are seen in older adults and produce lytic bone lesions filled with plasma cells.


### Q3.62
A 47-year-old man who is a _heavy alcohol drinker_ presents to the Emergency Department with _massive haematemesis_ after a _prolonged bout of vomiting_. His vital signs are temperature 36.7°C, pulse 112/min, respiratory rate 23/min and BP 80/40mmHg. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, and his lungs are clear to auscultation. His abdominal examination is unremarkable. His stool is negative for occult blood. 

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

	A. Oesophageal pulsion diverticulum 
	B. Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
	C. Oesophageal laceration (Mallory–Weiss syndrome) 
	D. Barrett’s oesophagus 
	E. Hiatus hernia

#### Answer: D. Barrett’s oesophagus - *FALSE* = C. Oesophageal laceration (_Mallory–Weiss_ syndrome) - TRUE

Longitudinal tears in the oesophagus at the oesophagogastric junction or gastric cardia are termed ‘Mallory–Weiss tears’ and are believed to be the consequence of severe retching or vomiting. They are encountered most commonly in people with alcohol problems, in whom they are attributed to episodes of excessive vomiting in the setting of an alcoholic stupor. Normally, a reflex relaxation of the musculature of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract precedes the anti-peristaltic wave of contraction. During episodes of prolonged vomiting, it is speculated that this reflex relaxation fails to occur. The refluxing gastric contents suddenly overwhelm the contraction of the musculature at the gastric inlet, and massive dilatation with tearing of the stretched wall ensues. As these tears may occur in people who have no history of vomiting or alcoholism, there must be other mechanisms; underlying hiatal hernia is a known predisposing factor. Oesophageal lacerations account for 5–10% of bleeding episodes in the upper GI tract.

Most often, bleeding is not profuse and ceases without surgical intervention, although massive haematemesis may occur. Supportive therapy, such as vasoconstrictive medications and transfusions, and sometimes balloon tamponade, is usually all that is required. Healing tends to be prompt, with minimal to no residua. The rare instance of oesophageal rupture is known as Boerhaave’s syndrome and may be a catastrophic event. Oesophageal variceal bleeding should also be suspected with such a history.

Diverticula of the oesophagus do not often bleed. Typical symptoms include dysphagia, food regurgitation and a mass in the neck; aspiration with resultant pneumonia is a significant risk. Barrett’s mucosa is associated with reflux with inflammation and possible ulceration, but bleeding is not usually massive.


### Q3.63
A 50-year-old man with complaints of _vague abdominal pain_, _unrelieved by over-the-counter antacid medications_, and nausea for the past 3 years had an upper GI endoscopy after an unremarkable clinical examination. The endoscopy revealed _antral mucosal erythema_, but no ulcerations or masses. Microscopic examination of the biopsies showed a _chronic non-specific gastritis_. 

Which of the following conditions is most likely to be present in this man? 

	A. Zollinger–Ellison syndrome - F 
	B. Helicobacter pylori infection 
	C. Pernicious anaemia - F
	D. Linitis plastica 
	E. Crohn’s disease - F

#### Answer: B. Helicobacter pylori infection - TRUE

##### _Helicobacter Pylori_ Infection
Chronic gastritis is defined as the presence of chronic mucosal inflammatory changes leading eventually to mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, usually in the absence of erosions. The epithelial changes may become dysplastic and constitute a background for the development of carcinoma. Chronic gastritis is notable for distinct causal subgroups and patterns of histological alterations that vary in different parts of the world. In the western world, the prevalence of histological changes indicative of chronic gastritis in the later decades of life is higher than 50%. By far the most important aetiological association with chronic gastritis is chronic infection by the bacillus Helicobacter pylori.

##### Zollinger–Ellison Syndrome
Zollinger and Ellison first called attention to the association of pancreatic islet cell lesions with hypersecretion of gastric acid and severe peptic ulceration, which are present in 90–95% of patients. In the Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, hypergastrinaemia from a pancreatic or duodenal tumour stimulates extreme gastric acid secretion, which in turn causes peptic ulceration. The duodenal and gastric ulcers are often multiple; although they are identical to those found in the general population, they are often unresponsive to the usual modalities of therapy. In addition, ulcers may also occur in unusual locations such as the jejunum; when intractable jejunal ulcers are found, the Zollinger–Ellison syndrome should be considered. More than 50% of the patients have diarrhoea; in 30%, it is the presenting symptom. This syndrome is rare.

##### Pernicious Anaemia
In pernicious anaemia the changes in the stomach are those of diffuse chronic gastritis. The most characteristic histological alteration is the atrophy of the fundic glands, affecting both chief cells and parietal cells, the latter being virtually absent. The glandular lining epithelium is replaced by mucus-secreting goblet cells that resemble those lining the large intestine, a form of metaplasia referred to as intestinalisation. Some of the cells, as well as their nuclei, may increase to double the normal size, a form of ‘megaloblastic’ change exactly analogous to that seen in the marrow. As will be seen, patients with pernicious anaemia have a higher incidence of gastric cancer. The gastric atrophic and metaplastic changes are the result of autoimmunity and not vitamin B12 deficiency; hence, parenteral administration of vitamin B12 corrects the bone marrow changes, but gastric atrophy and achlorhydria persist.

##### Crohn's Disease
Crohn’s disease involving the stomach is quite uncommon. The inflammation with crohn’s disease is transmural. Linitis plastica characterises a diffuse cancer with a poor prognosis.


### Q3.64
A 27-year-old man has experienced low-grade fevers, night sweats and generalised malaise for the past 3 months. On physical examination he has non-tender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. A cervical lymph node biopsy is performed. On microscopic examination at high magnification there are occasional _Reed–Sternberg cells_ along with large and small lymphocytes and bands of fibrosis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

	A. Burkitt’s lymphoma - F
	B. Tuberculosis (TB) - F
	C. Mycosis fungoides - F
	D. Multiple myeloma 
	E. Hodgkin’s disease

#### Answer: E. Hodgkin’s disease - TRUE

The term ‘Hodgkin’s lymphoma’ (HL), previously known as Hodgkin’s disease, encompasses a group of lymphoid neoplasms that differ from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) in several respects. Although NHL frequently occurs at extranodal sites and spreads in an unpredictable fashion, HL arises in a single node or chain of nodes and spreads first to the anatomically contiguous nodes. It is characterised morphologically by the presence of distinctive neoplastic giant cells called Reed–Sternberg cells, which induce the accumulation of reactive lymphocytes, histiocytes (macrophages) and granulocytes. Reed–Sternberg cells are multinucleated with large nucleoli. Variants called lacunar cells are also seen with some forms of Hodgkin’s disease.

TB results in a characteristic granulomatous inflammatory reaction that forms both caseating and non-caseating tubercles. The granulomata are usually enclosed within a fibroblastic rim punctuated by lymphocytes. Multinucleate giant cells are present in the granulomata. A monomorphous proliferation of intermediatesized lymphoid cells is seen with Burkitt’s lymphoma, often with accompanying macrophages. Mycosis fungoides (despite the name) is not a fungal disease, but a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. A proliferation of plasma cells leads to multiple myeloma, usually detected by monoclonal immunoglobulin production.


### Q3.65
A 32-year-old man with isolated enlargement of the left testis and a palpable left inguinal lymph node presents in a surgical outpatient clinic. He is advised to undergo scrotal ultrasonography. He also has a serum β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (βHCG) of 5 IU/L and α-fetoprotein (AFP) of 2ng/ml. The left testis is removed on the next available operation list. Gross examination on sectioning reveals a firm, lobulated, light-tan mass without haemorrhage or necrosis. The consultant surgeon asks his senior house officer to refer this man for radiotherapy. 

Which of the following testicular tumours is he most likely to have? 

	A. Seminoma 
	B. Choriocarcinoma 
	C. Embryonal carcinoma - F
	D. Yolk sac tumour - F
	E. Leydig’s cell tumour - F

#### Answer: A. Seminoma - TRUE

Seminomas are the most common type of germinal tumour (50%) and the type most likely to produce a uniform population of cells. They almost never occur in infants; they peak in those in their 30s. Seminomas produce bulky masses, sometimes ten times the size of the normal testis. The typical seminoma has a homogeneous, grey–white, lobulated, cut surface, usually devoid of haemorrhage or necrosis. In more than half of cases, the entire testis is replaced. Generally, the tunica albuginea is not penetrated, but occasionally, extension to the epididymis, spermatic cord or scrotal sac occurs. The tumour markers are not markedly elevated.

Choriocarcinomas are very aggressive tumours. A high hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) would suggest a component of choriocarcinoma. A high AFP (α-fetoprotein) would suggest embryonal carcinoma or yolk sac carcinoma. Embryonal carcinomas occur mostly in the 20- to 30-year age group. These tumours are more aggressive than seminomas. The yolk sac tumour is also known as infantile embryonal carcinoma or endodermal sinus tumour; it is of interest because it is the most common testicular tumour in infants and children aged up to 3 years. In this age group, it has a very good prognosis. In adults, the pure form of this tumour is rare; instead, yolk sac elements frequently occur in combination with embryonal carcinoma. Tumours of leydig cells are particularly interesting because they may produce androgens or combinations of androgens and oestrogens, and some have also produced corticosteroids. They arise at any age, although most of the reported cases have been noted between 20 and 60 years of age. As with other testicular tumours, the most common presenting feature is testicular swelling, but, in some patients, gynaecomastia may be the first symptom. In children, hormonal effects, manifested primarily as sexual precocity, are the dominating feature. About 10% of the tumours in adults are invasive and produce metastases; most are benign.


### Q3.66
During physical examination for the purpose of life insurance, a 38-year-old man is found to have a left inguinal mass. The right testis is palpated in the scrotum and is of normal size, but a left testis cannot be palpated in the scrotum. Ultrasonography shows that the inguinal mass is consistent with a cryptorchid testis. Which of the following approaches is most appropriate to deal with this patient’s testicular abnormality?

	A. Perform orchidopexy - F
	B. Remove both testes - F
	C. Commence testosterone therapy 
	D. Remove only the cryptorchid testis 
	E. Perform a chromosome analysis - F

#### Answer: D. Remove only the cryptorchid testis - TRUE

Cryptorchidism is synonymous with undescended testes and is found in about 1% of 1-year-old boys. This anomaly represents a complete or incomplete failure of the intra-abdominal testes to descend into the scrotal sac. It usually occurs as an isolated anomaly but may be accompanied by other malformations of the genitourinary tract, such as hypospadias. In this case the testis has been out of place too long to retain any function of spermatogenesis. It is now atrophic with few remaining germ cells and minimal, if any, spermatogenesis occurring. A cryptorchid testis at this age no longer functions and presents a risk for subsequent development of seminoma. The earlier in life that an orchidopexy is performed, generally under the age of 5, the more likely that the testis will function properly.

The opposite testis will not be affected by the cryptorchid testis. The patient still has one good testis. Even with bilateral cryptorchidism, the leydig cells of the testicular interstitium continue to function and produce testosterone. If this were testicular feminisation with androgen insensitivity, the phenotype would be female. If he had Klinefelter syndrome, the testes would be small and in the scrotum.


### Q3.67
A 78-year-old healthy man is noticed on a routine annual check-up to have a _firm nodule palpable_ in the prostate on digital rectal examination. Microscopic examination of the biopsies of this nodule _show small, crowded glands_ containing _cells with prominent nucleoli_ in the nuclei. This man is most likely to have which of the following conditions? 

	A. Benign prostatic hyperplasia  - F
	B. Chronic prostatitis 
	C. Metastatic urothelial carcinoma - F
	D. Infarction of the prostate - F
	E. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate

#### Answer: E. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate - TRUE

A prostatic nodule at this age strongly suggests carcinoma. In about 70% of cases, carcinoma of the prostate arises in the peripheral zone of the gland, classically in a posterior location, often rendering it palpable on rectal examination. Microscopically, prostatic adenocarcinomas have irregular glands without intervening stroma. Large nucleoli are characteristic.

Hyperplasia is usually not a focal process, and the glands are not small and crowded. Inflammation is usually not focal in the prostate. The most common tumour to involve the prostate secondarily is urothelial cancer. Two distinct patterns of involvement exist. Large, invasive, urothelial cancers can directly invade from the bladder into the prostate. Alternatively, carcinoma in situ of the bladder can extend into the prostatic urethra and down into the prostatic ducts and acini. Metastatic urothelial carcinoma would be an unusual pattern of metastasis. Urothelial carcinomas do not appear glandular. The glands around an infarct may show squamous metaplasia, but they will not be small and crowded.


### Q3.68
After a bee sting adrenaline is injected to prevent: 
    
    A. Local immune complex formation 
	B. Systemic anaphylaxis 
	C. Interleukin release from macrophages 
	D. Binding of anti-receptor antibody 
	E. Complement activation

#### Answer: B. Systemic anaphylaxis - TRUE

Exposure to the allergens of a bee sting is a cause for systemic anaphylaxis for some people. A bee sting will precipitate a type I hypersensitivity reaction and adrenaline (epinephrine) can be life saving in this situation.

Local immune complexes are a feature of type III hypersensitivity with farmer’s lung. 
Macrophages have a major role with type IV hypersensitivity reactions. Myasthenia gravis is an example of an anti-receptor disease of an autoimmune nature (type II hypersensitivity). Antibody is directed against acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. Many myasthenia gravis patients have a thymoma or thymic hyperplasia. Complement activation is a feature of type III hypersensitivity reactions.


### Q3.69
A 22-year-old woman has a solitary thyroid nodule. Which of the following statements about a _solitary thyroid nodule_ is true? 

	A. Hot nodules are much more likely to be neoplastic than cold ones - F
	B. Ultrasonography is a useful investigation for distinguishing cystic from solid lesions 
	C. Excision biopsy has no role in the management of a solitary thyroid nodule - F
	D. The actual type of a neoplasm is always determined by FNA cytology (FNAC) - F
	E. Sudden increase in the size of a solitary nodule over a period of 24 hours is a definite sign of malignancy - F
	
#### Answer: B. Ultrasonography is a useful investigation for distinguishing cystic from solid lesions - TRUE

About 20% of nodules that are hypofunctioning (cold) on a thyroid scintiscan are malignant, but most are benign. Hyperfunctioning (hot) nodules carry a low risk of malignancy, but exceptions occur. Ultrasonography is a sensitive method for determining whether a lesion is solid or cystic, but it cannot distinguish between benign and malignant nodules. Although thyroid cysts have a lower likelihood of being malignant, larger carcinomas can undergo cystic degeneration. Excision biopsy in the form of total lobectomy on the affected side, with isthmusectomy preserving the recurrent laryngeal nerves and parathyroids, not only aids in getting rid of the thyroid nodule, especially in patients with cancer phobia, but also provides adequate tissue for definitive histopathological diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is able to tell only whether a neoplasm is benign, malignant or indeterminate (suspicious). It can diagnose papillary carcinoma but mostly the actual type of a neoplasm cannot be determined by FNAC. Sudden increase in the size of a solitary nodule over a period of 24 h is usually the result of haemorrhage in a preexisting nodule and not a sign of malignancy.


### Q3.70
**Tamoxifen** is a _chemopreventive agent_ in breast cancer. Which of the following statements about tamoxifen is true? 

	A. It causes breast epithelial cells to rest in G0 phase 
	B. It is effective for women with hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer - F
	C. It has no effect on other body tissues and organs apart from the breast - F
	D. It is not effective in premenopausal patients - F
	E. It has side-effects similar to those of natural progesterone

#### Answer: A. It causes breast epithelial cells to rest in G0 phase - TRUE

There is an enormous amount of experimental and epidemiological data to support the role of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent in breast cancer. Tamoxifen is the oldest of all the selective oestrogen receptor modulators. It is prescribed for women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer before and after menopause. Tamoxifen causes breast epithelial cells to rest in G0; it induces apoptosis in tumours; in the adjuvant setting it reduces the risk of contralateral breast cancers. It is likely that tamoxifen acts not only through its oestrogen-blocking activity but also through other mechanisms independent of oestrogen receptors (ERs), such as stimulation of tissue fibroblasts to produce the negative paracrine growth factor called TGF (transforming growth factor). Tamoxifen also reduces the circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor I, which not only is a mitogen for breast epithelium but also stimulates the motility and metastatic potential of malignant cells.

Tamoxifen also influences activities of two other important enzymes: protein kinase c and calmodulin-dependent CAMP phosphodiesterase. Recently, tamoxifen has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and induce apoptosis. These other mechanisms of action of tamoxifen probably explain the counterintuitive response to tamoxifen seen among postmenopausal, ER-negative women in the world overview. Tamoxifen therapy is particularly effective in elderly postmenopausal women and is being used as the only initial treatment in this age group, with complete resolution of the tumours in 50% and reduction in size in a further 20%.

In a number of centres, patients aged 70 years and above are treated with tamoxifen (40mg daily) and surgical treatment is considered only if there is no response to the initial treatment. In premenopausal patients, 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the risk of recurrence and death, irrespective of whether chemotherapy has been given. Tamoxifen exerts a highly beneficial effect on bone metabolism, lipid profile and the myocardium. Tamoxifen reduces the risk of ischaemic heart disease by decreasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and osteoporosis by up to 50%. It has side-effects similar to those of natural oestrogens, including hot flushes, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, vaginal bleeding and discharge (resulting from some slight oestrogenic activity of the drug and some of its metabolites). Hypercalcaemia requiring cessation of the drug may occur. Tamoxifen can also lead to increased pain if the tumour has metastasised to bone. Tamoxifen has the potential to cause endometrial cancer.

4/10 = 40% - F: 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 80

### Q3.71
The histology report of a patient who had undergone surgery to remove a lump involving the right lobe of the thyroid gland came back as _papillary carcinoma_. Which of the following statements about this tumour is true? 

	A. It is commonly seen only in old age - F
	B. It classically presents with bone pain and tetany - F
	C. It has a poor prognosis 
	D. It disseminates via the haematogenous route 
	E. It is treated by total thyroidectomy with preservation of the parathyroid glands

#### Answer: E. It is treated by total thyroidectomy with preservation of the parathyroid glands - TRUE

Papillary thyroid carcinoma, comprising 85% of thyroid carcinomas, occurs in any age group but especially in children and women younger than 40. Classically it presents as a lump in the thyroid or less commonly as a solid swelling in a lymph node draining the thyroid, the primary in the thyroid being undetectable. Such a lymph node is often termed a ‘lateral aberrant thyroid’. It has an excellent prognosis. The 5-year survival rate is 90%, which is scarcely reduced at 10 years. Involvement of cervical nodes does not affect the prognosis adversely. Papillary carcinoma may be multifocal and metastasises to cervical lymph nodes. Its treatment by total thyroidectomy with preservation of the parathyroids is one school of thought on treatment. Another school of thought feels that this is rather too radical for a disease carrying such an excellent outlook and advises total thyroid lobectomy on the affected side with subtotal lobectomy on the contralateral side. There is a third approach that advocates only local removal of the tumour and T3 suppression of TSH.


### Q3.72
A patient with fat malabsorption caused by biliary tract disease develops vitamin K deficiency. Which of the following clotting factors will not be carboxylated in this patient? 

	A. Factor VII 
	B. Factor V 
	C. Factor XII 
	D. Factor XI 
	E. Factor VIII

### Answer: A. Factor VII - TRUE

Vitamin K is a required cofactor for a liver microsomal carboxylase that is necessary to convert glutamyl residues in certain protein precursors to γ-carboxyglutamates. Clotting factors VII, IX and X, and prothrombin all require carboxylation of glutamate residues for functional activity. Carboxylation provides calcium-binding sites and thus allows calcium-dependent interaction of these clotting factors with a phospholipid surface involved in the generation of thrombin. In addition, activation of anticoagulant proteins c and S also requires glutamate carboxylation. In the course of the reaction of vitamin K with its substrate proteins, its active (reduced) form is oxidised to an epoxide but then it is promptly reduced back by a liver epoxide reductase. Thus, in a healthy liver, vitamin K is efficiently recycled, and the daily dietary requirement is low.

Furthermore, endogenous intestinal bacterial flora readily synthesise the vitamin. Deficiency usually occurs: (1) in fat malabsorption syndromes, particularly with biliary tract disease, as with the other fat-soluble vitamins; (2) after destruction of the endogenous vitamin K-synthesising flora, particularly with ingestion of broad-spectrum antibiotics; (3) in the neonatal period, when liver reserves are small, the bacterial flora not yet developed and the level of vitamin K in breast milk low; and (4) in diffuse liver disease, even in the presence of normal vitamin K stores, because hepatocyte dysfunction interferes with synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. In patients with thromboembolic disease, therapeutically desirable vitamin K deficiency is induced by coumarin anticoagulants (eg warfarin). These agents block the activity of liver epoxide reductase and thereby prevent regeneration of reduced vitamin K. The major consequence of vitamin K deficiency (or of inefficient use of vitamin K by the liver) is the development of a bleeding diathesis.


### Q3.73
A patient with a _defective neutrophil NADPH oxidase_ system will be unable to generate: 

	A. Bactericidal permeability increasing protein 
	B. Reactive oxygen intermediates 
	C. Lysozyme 
	D. Major basic protein
	E. Defensins
	
#### Answer: B. Reactive oxygen intermediates - TRUE

The ultimate step in the elimination of infectious agents and necrotic cells is their killing and degradation within neutrophils and macrophages, which occur most efficiently after activation of the phagocytes. Microbial killing is accomplished largely by oxygen-dependent mechanisms. Phagocytosis stimulates a burst in oxygen consumption, glycogenolysis, increased glucose oxidation via the hexose monophosphate shunt and production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs, also called reactive oxygen species). The generation of ROIs is the result of the rapid activation of an oxidase (NADPH oxidase), which oxidises NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and, in the process, reduces oxygen to the superoxide anion. Superoxide is then converted into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), mostly by spontaneous dismutation. Hydrogen peroxide can also be further reduced to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. Most of the H2O2 is eventually broken down by catalase into H2O and O2, and some is destroyed by the action of glutathione oxidase.

NADPH oxidase is an enzyme complex consisting of at least seven proteins. In resting neutrophils, different NADPH oxidase protein components are located in the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm. In response to activating stimuli, the cytosolic protein components translocate to the plasma membrane or phagosomal membrane, where they assemble and form the functional enzyme complex. Thus, the ROIs are produced within the lysosome where the ingested substances are segregated, and the cell’s own organelles are protected from the harmful effects of the ROIs. Defects in the NADPH oxidase system will affect the generation of ROIs. Bactericidal permeability, increasing protein, lysozyme, major basic proteins and defensins are all oxygen-independent mechanisms that help accomplish bacterial killing by leukocytes.


### Q3.74
The _critical step_ in the elaboration of the _biological functions of complement_ is the activation of: 
    
    A. C1 
	B. C2 
	C. C3 
	D. C4 
	E. C5

#### Answer: B. C2 - *FALSE* = C. C3 - TRUE

The complement system consists of 20 component proteins (and their cleavage products), which are found in their greatest concentration in the plasma. This system functions in both innate and adaptive immunity for defence against microbial agents. In the process of complement activation, a number of complement components are elaborated that cause increased vascular permeability, chemotaxis and opsonisation.

Complement proteins are present as inactive forms in plasma and are numbered C1–C9. Many of these proteins are activated to become proteolytic enzymes that degrade other complement proteins, thus forming a cascade capable of tremendous enzymatic amplification. The critical step in the elaboration of the biological functions of complement is the activation of the third (and most abundant) component: C3. Cleavage of C3 can occur by one of three pathways: the classic pathway, which is triggered by fixation of C1 to antibody (IgM or IgG) combined with antigen; the alternative pathway, which can be triggered by microbial surface molecules (eg endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide), complex polysaccharides, cobra venom and other substances, in the absence of antibody; and the lectin pathway, in which plasma mannose-binding lectin binds to carbohydrates on microbes and directly activates C1.

Whichever pathway is involved in the early steps of complement activation, they all lead to the formation of an active enzyme called the C3 convertase, which splits C3 into two functionally distinct fragments: C3a and C3b. C3a is released and C3b becomes covalently attached to the cell or molecule where complement is being activated. C3b then binds to the previously generated fragments to form C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 to release C5a. The remaining C5b binds the late components (C6–C9), culminating in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC, composed of multiple C9 molecules).


### Q3.75
The intrinsic clotting pathway is triggered by activation of Hageman factor (factor XII) on contact with negatively charged surfaces, such as collagen and basement membranes. Which other system is triggered by activation of factor XII? 

	A. Complement system 
	B. Renin–angiotensin system 
	C. Cyclo-oxygenase pathway 
	D. Kinin system 
	E. Lipoxygenase pathway
	
#### Answer: B. Renin–angiotensin system - *FALSE* = D. Kinin system - TRUE

The kinin system generates vasoactive peptides from plasma proteins, called kininogens, by the action of specific proteases called kallikreins. Activation of the kinin system results in the release of the vasoactive nonapeptide bradykinin. Bradykinin increases vascular permeability and causes contraction of smooth muscle, dilatation of blood vessels and pain when injected into the skin. These effects are similar to those of histamine. The cascade that eventually produces kinins is triggered by activation of Hageman factor (factor XII of the intrinsic clotting pathway) on contact with negatively charged surfaces, such as collagen and basement membranes. A fragment of factor XII (prekallikrein activator or factor XIIa) is produced, and this converts plasma prekallikrein into an active proteolytic form, the enzyme kallikrein. The latter cleaves a plasma glycoprotein precursor, high-molecular-weight kininogen, to produce bradykinin. High-molecular-weight kininogen also acts as a cofactor or catalyst in the activation of Hageman factor. The action of bradykinin is short-lived because it is quickly inactivated by an enzyme called kininase. Any remaining kinin is inactivated during the passage of plasma through the lung by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Kallikrein itself is a potent activator of Hageman factor, allowing for autocatalytic amplification of the initial stimulus. Kallikrein has chemotactic activity and also directly converts C5 to the chemoattractant product C5a.


### Q3.76
A 72-year-old woman is diagnosed with _carcinoma of the gallbladder_. Which of the following statements about this tumour is _true_? 

	A. Carcinoma of the gallbladder predominantly affects males - F
	B. Gallstones are not associated with this tumour - F
	C. At the time of diagnosis most tumours are limited to the gallbladder 
	D. Of the tumours, 95% are squamous cell carcinomas 
	E. The 5-year survival rate is 1% despite surgical intervention - F

#### Answer: C. At the time of diagnosis most tumours are limited to the gallbladder - *FALSE* = E. The 5-year survival rate is 1% despite surgical intervention - TRUE

Carcinoma of the gallbladder is slightly more common in women and occurs most frequently in the seventh decade of life. Only rarely is it discovered at a resectable stage, and the mean 5-year survival rate has remained for many years at about 1%, despite surgical intervention. Gallstones are present in 60–90% of cases. In Asia, where pyogenic and parasitic diseases of the biliary tree are common, the coexistence of gallstones is much lower. Presumably, gallbladders containing stones or infectious agents develop cancer as a result of irritative trauma and chronic inflammation. Carcinogenic derivatives of bile acids may also play a role. Most carcinomas of the gallbladder are adenocarcinomas. Some are papillary in architecture and are well to moderately differentiated; others are infiltrative and poorly differentiated to undifferentiated. About 5% are squamous cell carcinomas or have adenosquamous differentiation. A minority may exhibit carcinoid or a variety of mesenchymal features. By the time these neoplasms are discovered, most have invaded the liver centrifugally, and many have extended to the cystic duct and adjacent bile ducts and portahepatic lymph nodes. The peritoneum, gastrointestinal tract and lungs are common sites of seeding.


### Q3.77
A 35-year-old man presented with a painless, slow-growing, mobile, discrete mass within the superficial lobe of the parotid gland. He underwent _superficial parotidectomy_. Histology of the mass showed _epithelial elements_ dispersed within a _mesenchyme-like_ background of _loose myxoid tissue_ containing _islands of cartilage_ and _foci of bone_. This patient is most likely to have: 
    
    A. Oncocytoma 
	B. Warthin’s tumour 
	C. Pleomorphic adenoma 
	D. Basal cell adenoma 
	E. Canalicular adenoma

#### Answer: C. Pleomorphic adenoma - TRUE

The histology is characteristic of pleomorphic adenoma. These neoplasms have also been called mixed tumours. They represent about 60% of tumours in the parotid, are less common in the submandibular glands and are relatively rare in the minor salivary glands. They are benign tumours that are derived from a mixture of ductal (epithelial) and myoepithelial cells, and therefore they show both epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation. They also reveal epithelial elements dispersed throughout a matrix along with varying degrees of myxoid, hyaline, chondroid (cartilaginous) and even osseous tissue. In some tumours, the epithelial elements predominate; in others, they are present only in widely dispersed foci. Little is known about the origins of these neoplasms except that radiation exposure increases the risk. Equally uncertain is the histogenesis of the various components. A currently popular view is that all neoplastic elements, including those that appear to be mesenchymal, are of either myoepithelial or ductal reserve cell origin (hence the designation pleomorphic adenoma). Most pleomorphic adenomas present as rounded, well-demarcated masses rarely exceeding 6cm in the greatest dimension. Although they are encapsulated, in some locations (particularly the palate) the capsule is not fully developed, and the expansile growth produces tongue-like protrusions into the surrounding gland, rendering enucleation of the tumour hazardous. The cut surface is grey–white with myxoid and blue translucent areas of chondroid.


### Q3.78
Three days after a fracture of the right femur and tibia, a patient on the orthopaedic ward was noticed to develop sudden onset of _tachypnoea, dyspnoea and tachycardia_, accompanied by _progressive delirium_ and a _diffuse petechial rash_ in non-dependent areas. This clinical picture is suggestive of: 
    
    A. Pulmonary embolism (PE)
	B. Fat embolism 
	C. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
	D. Air embolism 
	E. Systemic thromboembolism

#### Answer: A. Pulmonary embolism (PE) - *FALSE* = B. Fat embolism - TRUE

The clinical picture in this case is suggestive of fat embolism. Fat embolism syndrome is characterised by pulmonary insufficiency, neurological symptoms, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Microscopic fat globules may be found in the circulation after fractures of long bones (which have fatty marrow) or, rarely, in the setting of soft-tissue trauma and burns. Presumably the fat is released by marrow or adipose tissue injury and enters the circulation by rupture of marrow vascular sinusoids or venules. Although traumatic fat embolism occurs in some 90% of individuals with severe skeletal injuries, less than 10% of such patients have any clinical findings. Symptoms typically begin 1–3 days after injury, with sudden onset of tachypnoea, dyspnoea and tachycardia. Neurological symptoms include irritability and restlessness, with progression to delirium or coma. Patients may present with thrombocytopenia, presumably caused by platelets adhering to the myriad fat globules and being removed from the circulation; anaemia may result as a consequence of erythrocyte aggregation and haemolysis. A diffuse petechial rash in non-dependent areas (related to rapid onset of thrombocytopenia) is seen in 20–50% of cases and is useful in establishing a diagnosis. In its full-blown form, the syndrome is fatal in up to 10% of cases.

The pathogenesis of fat emboli syndrome probably involves both mechanical obstruction and biochemical injury. Microemboli of neutral fat cause occlusion of the pulmonary and cerebral microvasculature, aggravated by local platelet and erythrocyte aggregation; this is further exacerbated by release of free fatty acids from the fat globules, causing local toxic injury to endothelium. Platelet activation and recruitment of granulocytes (with free radical, protease and eicosanoid release) complete the vascular assault.


### Q3.79
Mast cells have cytoplasmic membrane-bound granules that contain a variety of biologically active mediators. Which of the following is a _mediator_ contained within _mast-cell granules_? 

	A. Chondroitin sulphate 
	B. Leukotriene C4 (LTC4) 
	C. Prostaglandin D2 
	D. Platelet-activating factor 
	E. IL-1

#### Answer: D. Platelet-activating factor - *FALSE* = A. Chondroitin sulphate - TRUE

Primary mediators contained within mast-cell granules can be divided into three categories:

1. Biogenic amines: the most important vasoactive amine is histamine, which causes intense smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability and increased secretion by nasal, bronchial and gastric glands.
2. Enzymes: these are contained in the granule matrix and include neutral proteases (chymase, tryptase) and several acid hydrolases. The enzymes cause tissue damage and lead to the generation of kinins and activated components of complement (eg C3a) by acting on their precursor proteins.
3. Proteoglycans: these include heparin, a well-known anticoagulant, and chondroitin sulphate. The proteoglycans serve to package and store the other mediators in the granules.


### Q3.80
Which of the following cytokines is an _endogenous pyrogen_? 

	A. Transforming growth factor-β 
	B. IL-2 
	C. Interferon-γ 
	D. IL-1 
	E. IL-6

#### Answer: B. IL-2 - *FALSE* = D. IL-1 - TRUE

Fever, characterised by an elevation of body temperature, usually by 1–4°C, is one of the most prominent manifestations of the acute-phase response, especially when inflammation is associated with infection. Fever is produced in response to substances called pyrogens that act by stimulating prostaglandin synthesis in the vascular and perivascular cells of the hypothalamus. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharides (called exogenous pyrogens), stimulate leukocytes to release cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF (called endogenous pyrogens), which increase the enzymes (cyclo-oxygenases) that convert arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. In the hypothalamus, the prostaglandins, especially PGE2, stimulate the production of neurotransmitters such as CAMP, which function to reset the temperature set-point at a higher level. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, reduce fever by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase and thus blocking prostaglandin synthesis.


Questions 3.81-3.90
-------------------

8/10 = 80% - F: 81, 82

### Question 81
Which of the following is an _acute-phase protein_? 

	A. IL-1
	B. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)
	C. IL-6
	D. IL-2
	E. Fibrinogen

#### Answer: B. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) - *FALSE* = E. Fibrinogen - TRUE

Acute-phase proteins are plasma proteins, mostly synthesised in the liver, with plasma concentrations that may increase several hundredfold as part of the response to inflammatory stimuli. Three of the best-known examples of these proteins are c-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and serum amyloid A (SAA). Synthesis of these molecules by hepatocytes is upregulated by cytokines, especially IL-6 (for CRP and fibrinogen) and IL-1 or TNF (for SAA). Many acute-phase proteins, such as CRP and SAA, bind to microbial cell walls, and may act as opsonins and fix complement. They also bind chromatin, possibly aiding in the clearing of necrotic cell nuclei. During the acute-phase response, SAA replaces apolipoprotein A, a component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. This may alter the targeting of HDLs from liver cells to macrophages, which can use these particles as a source of energy-producing lipids. The rise in fibrinogen causes erythrocytes to form stacks (rouleaux) that sediment more rapidly at unit gravity than individual erythrocytes. This is the basis for measuring the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as a simple test for the systemic inflammatory response, caused by any number of stimuli, including lipopolysaccharides. Acute-phase proteins have beneficial effects during acute inflammation, but prolonged production of these proteins (especially SAA) causes secondary amyloidosis in chronic inflammation. Elevated serum levels of CRP are now used as a marker for increased risk of myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease. It is believed that inflammation involving atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries may predispose to thrombosis and subsequent infarction, and CRP is produced during inflammation.


### Q3.82
A 40-year-old woman with orthostatic hypotension is suspected of having primary hypoaldosteronism. Which of the following laboratory values will substantiate this diagnosis? 

	| Serum Na 	| Serum K	| Serum HCO3	| Urine Na	| Urine K	|
----|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
A	| Decreased	| Increased | Decreased 	| Increased | Decreased 
B 	| Decreased | Increased | Increased 	| Increased | Decreased 
C 	| Decreased | Decreased | Decreased 	| Increased | Increased 
D 	| Increased | Decreased | Increased 	| Decreased | Increased 
E 	| Increased | Increased	| Increased		| Decreased	| Decreased 

#### Answer: B. - *FALSE* = A. - TRUE

Aldosterone is the main sodium-retaining hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It increases the reabsorption of sodium and water along with the excretion of potassium in the distal tubules of the kidneys. This action raises blood pressure. Hypoaldosteronism results in salt wasting, thereby decreasing serum sodium and increasing urine sodium. As water follows sodium, the patient may develop orthostatic hypotension or become frankly hypotensive. In response to the electrical gradient established by sodium reabsorption, aldosterone induces the passive secretion of potassium at the distal convoluted tubule, promoting potassium excretion. Hypoaldosteronism would, in contrast, increase serum potassium and decrease urine potassium. Aldosterone causes hydrogen ions to be actively secreted into the distal tubule. Therefore, in hypoaldosteronism, H+ ions are retained, creating a metabolic acidosis (decreased HCO3–).
 

### Q3.83
A 62-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Department after a sudden myocardial infarction. On arrival he is in pulmonary oedema with an audible third heart sound and distended jugular veins. His ECG shows prominent Q waves in the lateral chest leads. 

Which of the following haemodynamic parameters will be consistent with this patient’s condition?

- PAWP = pulmonary artery wedge pressure
- CVP = central venous pressure

	| Preload	| CO	|  PAWP | CVP	| Vascular Resistance	| Mixed venous O2	|
----|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-----------------------|-------------------|
A 	| D 		| D 	| I 	| D 	| D						| D

D 	| I 		| I 	| D 	| D 	| D 					| I
E 	| D 		| I 	| D 	| D 	| D 					| I

#### Answer: B. - TRUE

This is a classical picture of cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is characterized by a decreased pumping ability of the heart that causes a shocklike state (ie global hypoperfusion). It most commonly occurs in association with, and as a direct result of, acute myocardial infarction. Similar to other shock states, cardiogenic shock is considered to be a clinical diagnosis characterized by decreased urine output, altered mentation, and hypotension. Other clinical characteristics include jugular venous distension, cardiac gallop, and pulmonary oedema. Cardiogenic shock is defined as sustained hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90mmHg lasting more than 30 min) with evidence of tissue hypoperfusion with adequate left ventricular filling pressure. Tissue hypoperfusion is defined as cold peripheries (extremities colder than core), oliguria (<30ml/h), or both. In cardiogenic shock left ventricular function is compromised; therefore cardiac output is diminished. Preload is increased because blood from the right side of the heart and pulmonary circulation is pumped into an already filled left ventricle (this explains the S3 and S4 sounds). Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) measured with a Swan–Ganz catheter, reveals left atrial pressure as well as left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and is elevated in heart failure. Increased left atrial pressure results in pulmonary oedema. Eventually, the right ventricle can no longer pump blood against the increased pulmonary pressure and fails. This causes a back up of blood which results in increased central venous pressure. Systemic vascular resistance is increased in an attempt to compensate for diminished cardiac output. Mixed venous oxygen levels are reduced because of increased tissue demands for oxygen.


### Q3.84
A severely ill patient in _septic shock_ after a perforated duodenal ulcer develops acute renal failure (ARF) with **azotaemia** and oliguria. The urine osmolality approaches that of the glomerular ultrafiltrate. A renal biopsy would be most likely to show which of the following? 

	A. Acute pyelonephritis 
	B. Renal cell carcinoma 
	C. Acute tubular necrosis 
	D. Crescentic glomerulonephritis 
	E. Chronic glomerulonephritis

#### Answer: C. Acute tubular necrosis - TRUE

Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the death of tubular cells, which may result when tubular cells either do not get enough oxygen (ischaemic ATN) or have been exposed to a toxic drug or molecule (nephrotoxic ATN). Fortunately, new tubular cells usually replace those that have died. Indeed, the tubular cells of the kidneys undergo a continuous cycle of cell death and renewal, much like the cells of the skin. In the hospital setting, ATN is the most common cause of acute renal failure (ARF). Hospital patients often have acute medical problems that limit the oxygen supplied to the tubules or that cause tubular hypoperfusion (decreased blood flow).

Certain medical and surgical situations are associated with a high risk for developing ischaemic ATN:

- Hypotension (low blood pressure)
- Obstetric (birth-related) complications
- Obstructive jaundice (yellow-tinged skin caused by blocked flow of bile)
- Prolonged prerenal state
- Sepsis (infection in the blood or tissues)
- Surgery (eg open heart surgery, repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm).

Some medications and clinical materials can cause nephrotoxic ATN:

– Aminoglycosides (antibacterial antibiotics such as streptomycin and gentamicin)
- Amphotericin B (antibiotic used to treat some forms of meningitis and systemic fungal infections)
- Cisplatin (anticancer agent used to treat late-stage ovarian and testicular cancers)
- Radioisotopic contrast media (agent used in certain imaging studies).

Exposure to certain molecules may also cause nephrotoxic ATN, eg when a person suffers significant muscle trauma, such as during a crush injury, the muscle enzyme creatine phosphokinase (CPK) leaks into the blood. Myoglobulin is the protein that leaks into the blood and ultimately causes ATN. Measurement of CPK is a marker of myoglobulin released by muscle cells. If enough CPK spills into the blood and is filtered through the glomeruli, it can damage the tubules, causing nephrotoxic ATN.


### Q3.85
A 35-year-old woman who is a secretary develops a pea-sized, translucent nodule on the wrist, which when excised shows cystic degeneration without a true cell lining. Which of the following is the most probable diagnosis? 

	A. Villonodular synovitis 
	B. Synovial cyst 
	C. Rheumatoid nodule 
	D. Ganglion cyst 
	E. Gout

#### Answer: D. Ganglion cyst - TRUE

A ganglion cyst is a bump or mass that forms under the skin. A swelling on the back of the wrist or fingers is the most obvious sign. These cysts can be painless but are often associated with tenderness, which may restrict the range of movements. Most commonly, ganglia are seen on the wrist (usually the back side) and fingers, but they can also develop on the shoulder, elbow and knee. They form when tissues surrounding certain joints become inflamed and swell up with lubricating fluid, and can increase in size when the tissue is irritated or just appear to grow. However, they are not tumours or cancerous. Ganglia are harmless and if there is no pain or other complications they are usually left alone. They sometimes just disappear anyway.

Initial treatment may simply involve limiting the activities that place a strain on the affected area, resting the joint and supporting it in a splint. Draining the fluid from the cyst may help ease symptoms. If the ganglion is persistent surgical removal may be recommended. Ganglion cysts characteristically lack a true lining, which distinguishes them morphologically from synovial cysts.


### Q3.86
A 28-year-old man with a history of significant weight loss and drenching night sweats presents to his general practitioner with a lump in the left side of his neck. He is referred for biopsy of the mass, which reveals **Reed–Sternberg cells**. Further evaluation after the biopsy report shows nodal involvement limited to the neck and axilla. What stage of disease has he got? 

	A. IA - F
	B. IB - F
	C. IIA 
	D. IIB 
	E. IIIB - F
	
### Answer: D. IIB - TRUE

This patient has Hodgkin’s lymphoma (as suggested by the characteristic Reed–Sternberg cells). The most common presenting symptom for Hodgkin’s lymphoma is painless lymph node enlargement, most frequently involving nodes on the neck. More generalised lymph node enlargement is also common, but systemic spread to the liver, lungs, bone narrow and other organs is usually a late event. Although localised disease usually occurs in lymph nodes above the diaphragm, isolated infradiaphragmatic disease may occur, and tends to be more common with the lymphocyte predominant type. Characteristic systemic symptoms, known as ‘B’ symptoms, are unexplained fevers, drenching night sweats and weight loss of >10% of total body weight. Presence of these symptoms is an adverse prognostic factor. Other characteristic symptoms, although less clearly associated with poor prognosis, are fatigue, generalised pruritus and alcohol-induced pain in affected lymph nodes. The lymphatic spread of Hodgkin’s lymphoma usually occurs in a stepwise fashion to contiguous lymph nodes. Anatomical staging, based on the Ann Arbor system (as shown below), has largely determined treatment decisions. The suffix ‘B’ is added to the stage category for patients with systemic symptoms (ie fever, night sweats and weight loss), whereas patients without systemic symptoms are designated ‘A’.


### Q3.87
A 24-year-old woman presents in a surgical outpatient clinic with paraesthesia of the right shoulder and arm. On palpation a hard bony structure is noticed above the clavicle on the affected side. Which of the following conditions best accounts for her symptoms? 

	A. Osteoporosis - F
	B. Pancoast’s tumour 
	C. Shoulder dislocation - F 
	D. Horner’s syndrome - F 
	E. Thoracic outlet obstruction

#### Answer: B. Pancoast’s tumour - *FALSE* - E. Thoracic outlet obstruction (_cervical rib_) - TRUE

This patient has symptoms suggestive of thoracic outlet obstruction caused by a cervical rib. Cervical ribs are an anomaly arising from the lowest cervical vertebrae but their relationship to the thoracic outlet syndrome is not such that the two conditions should be seen as synonymous. Perhaps no more than 10% of people who have cervical ribs develop the thoracic outlet syndrome and the syndrome may well occur in the absence of ribs. One problem in terms of diagnosis is that there may be a fibrous band that acts like a rib; however, not being calcified it does not appear on radiographs. There is also considerable controversy in the literature as to whether the condition actually exists. Some authors claim that it is under-diagnosed whereas others say that it is over-diagnosed.

The syndrome involves compression, injury or irritation to the neurovascular structures at the root of the neck or upper thorax. The boundaries are the anterior and middle scalenes, the clavicle and first rib, with possible hypertrophy of the subclavius or under the pectoralis minor muscle. Compression may involve nerves, including the brachial plexus, usually the lower trunk or medial cord.

It could involve compression of the subclavian artery, vein or both. Thrombosis, embolism or aneurysm of these vessels is less likely. With so much uncertainty and dispute over the diagnosis, it is not possible to give a meaningful figure for incidence but the true neurological type probably affects no more than one in a million. The overall incidence is given as between 3 and 80 per 1000. Onset is from the second to eighth decades with a peak in the fourth decade. It is more common in women than in men with an excess of between three- and ninefold.


### Q3.88
A 15-year-old girl complains of _fatigue and palpitations_. Clinical examination shows pale mucous membranes and a _systolic murmur_. A peripheral blood smear shows _hypochromic/microcytic_ red blood cells. 

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

	A. Iron deficiency 
	B. Folate deficiency - F
	C. Sickle cell anaemia - F
	D. Vitamin B12 deficiency - F
	E. Hereditary spherocytosis - F

#### Answer: A. Iron deficiency - TRUE

Deficiency of iron is probably the most common nutritional disorder in the world. Although the prevalence of iron-deficiency anaemia is higher in developing countries, this form of anaemia is also common in the west, particularly in toddlers, adolescent girls and women of childbearing age. An iron deficiency can result from: (1) dietary lack, (2) impaired absorption, (3) increased requirement or (4) chronic blood loss. The dominating signs and symptoms frequently relate to the underlying cause of the anaemia, eg gastrointestinal or gynaecological disease, malnutrition, pregnancy and malabsorption.

The diagnosis of iron-deficiency anaemia ultimately rests on laboratory studies. Both the haemoglobin and haematocrit are depressed, usually to moderate levels, in association with hypochromia, microcytosis and some poikilocytosis. The serum iron and ferritin are low, and the total plasma iron-binding capacity (reflecting transferrin concentration) is high. Low serum iron with increased iron-binding capacity results in a reduction of transferrin saturation levels to below 15%. Reduced iron stores inhibit hepcidin synthesis and its serum levels fall. The level of soluble transferrin receptors, which are mostly derived from erythroid progenitors in the marrow, is elevated in iron deficiency as a result of a mild expansion of erythroid progenitors and an increased rate of transferrin receptor shedding. Reduced haem synthesis leads to elevation of free erythrocyte protoporphyrin. An alert clinician investigating unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia will occasionally discover an occult bleed or cancer and thereby save a life.


### Q3.89
After a total hip replacement a 72-year-old woman develops wound infection with **methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_** (MRSA). Which of the following antibiotics will be effective against this bacterium? 

	A. Ampicillin 
	B. Gentamicin 
	C. Cefotaxime 
	D. Cefazolin 
	E. Vancomycin

#### Answer: B. Vancomycin - TRUE

Vancomycin is the antibiotic of choice in this situation. Vancomycin is a parenteral glycopeptide antibiotic obtained from Nocardia orientalis. It is bactericidal and appears to exert its effect by binding to the precursor units of bacterial cell walls, inhibiting their synthesis. This binding occurs at a different site of action from that of penicillin. The net result is an alteration of bacterial cell wall permeability. In addition, RNA synthesis is inhibited. Perhaps as a result of this dual mechanism of action, resistance to vancomycin is uncommon, although it has been reported in strains of group D streptococci. Gram-negative organisms are not sensitive to vancomycin, perhaps because porin channels in the cell wall of the Gram-negative organism do not accommodate the large, bulky vancomycin molecule. 

Susceptible organisms are usually sensitive to concentrations of 1–5µg/ml, even methicillin-resistant strains. It is effective for the treatment of Gram-positive infection caused by susceptible organism(s), particularly, staphylococcal infection including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and for streptococcal and enterococcal infections in patients who are allergic to penicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics, in the following infections: endocarditis, bone and joint infections (eg osteomyelitis), lower respiratory tract infections (eg pneumonia), intra-abdominal infections (eg peritonitis), skin and skin structure infections (eg diabetic foot ulcer), bacteraemia or septicaemia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). In the average-sized adult, an initial dosage of 1000mg i.v. Or 15mg/kg i.v. every 12 hours can be used, although individualisation of the dosage regimen may be necessary.


### Q3.90
A patient treated for a life-threatening Gram-negative sepsis with an intravenous antibiotic complained of _disturbed hearing_ and _loss of balance_. Which of the following antibiotics is responsible for this side-effect? 

	A. Amoxicillin 
	B. Cefuroxime 
	C. Cefotaxime 
	D. Gentamicin 
	E. Ciprofloxacin

#### Answer: D. Gentamicin - TRUE

Aminoglycoside antibiotics such as streptomycin and gentamicin are commonly used throughout the world because of their low costs, high effectiveness and low rate of true resistance. They are active against a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria, as well as against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Aminoglycosides are used primarily for the treatment of life-threatening infections such as peritonitis, bacteraemia, pneumonia and endocarditis, as well as UTIs, cystic fibrosis and TB. However, their use is severely hampered by the risk of serious side-effects such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, leading to kidney failure and hearing loss. Accumulation of aminoglycosides in vestibular and cochlear sensory cells of the inner ear leads to cell death, resulting in progressive hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction.

In contrast to aminoglycoside-mediated nephrotoxicity, effects on the cochlear and vestibular systems are largely irreversible. The effects are therefore cumulative with multiple rounds of treatment. The incidence of ototoxicity varies greatly, depending on the treatment regimen and the drugs used, ranging from 10–20% in the acute setting to up to 80% in patients receiving chronic therapy for TB. Deafness affects around 0.5–8% of treated individuals. Vestibular toxicity affects around 3%.


Questions 3.91-3.100
--------------------

5/10 = 50% - F: 91, 92, 96, 98, 99

### Q3.91
A patient admitted for elective cholecystectomy is detected as being _infected with hepatitis B_ on preoperative screening. Which of the following serological markers signifies _active viral replication_ in this patient? 

	A. HBsAg 
	B. HBeAg 
	C. IgM anti-HBc 
	D. IgG anti-HBc 
	E. IgG anti-HBs 

#### Answer: D. IgG anti-HBc - *FALSE* = B. HBeAg - TRUE

After exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV), the long asymptomatic 4-to 26-week incubation period (mean: 6–8 weeks) is followed by acute disease lasting many weeks to months. Most patients experience a self-limited illness:

- HBsAg appears before the onset of symptoms, peaks during overt disease and then declines to undetectable levels in 3–6 months.
overt disease and then declines to undetectable levels in 3–6 months.
- HBeAg, HBV-DNA and DNA polymerase appear in the serum soon after HBsAg, and all signify active viral replication.
- IgM anti-HBC becomes detectable in serum shortly before the onset of symptoms, concurrent with the onset of elevation of serum aminotransferases. Over months, the IgM antibody is replaced by IgG anti-HBC.
- Anti-HBe is detectable shortly after the disappearance of HBeAg, implying that the acute infection has peaked and the disease is on the wane.
- IgG anti-HBs does not rise until the acute disease is over and is usually not detectable for a few weeks to several months after the disappearance of HBsAg. Anti-HBs may persist for life, conferring protection; this is the basis for current immunisation strategies using non-infectious HBsAg.

### Q3.92
A variety of diseases has been found to be associated with certain HLA alleles. Which of the following disorders is associated with HLA-B27?

	A. Chronic active hepatitis - F
	B. Postgonococcal arthritis - F
	C. Rheumatoid arthritis 
	D. Primary Sjögren’s syndrome - F
	E. Type 2 diabetes - F

#### Answer: C. Rheumatoid arthritis - *FALSE* = B. Postgonococcal arthritis - TRUE

A variety of diseases has been found to be associated with certain HLA (human leukocyte antigen) alleles. The best known is the association between ankylosing spondylitis and HLA-B27; individuals who inherit this allele have a 90-fold greater chance (relative risk) of developing the disease than those who are negative for HLA-B27. The diseases that show association with the HLA locus can be broadly grouped into the following categories:

- Inflammatory diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis and several postinfectious arthropathies such as postgonococcal arthritis, all associated with HLA-B27
- Inherited errors of metabolism, such as 21-hydroxylase deficiency (HLA-BW47) and hereditary haemochromatosis (HLA-A)
- Autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune endocrinopathies, associated mainly with alleles at the DR locus.

### Q3.93
A 65-year-old man, who is a smoker and has intermittent haematuria and costovertebral pain, presents to the Emergency Department with _haemoptysis_. On clinical examination, there is a _palpable mass in the left flank_ and his laboratory investigations show _polycythaemia_, _hypercalcaemia_ and _eosinophilia_. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this man? 

	A. Oncocytoma of the left kidney 
	B. Angiomyolipoma of the left kidney 
	C. Renal cell carcinoma of the left kidney 
	D. Renal hamartoma of the left kidney 
	E. Wilms’ tumour of the left kidney

#### Answer: C. Renal cell carcinoma of the left kidney - TRUE

Renal cell carcinomas represent about 1–3% of all visceral cancers and account for 85% of renal cancers in adults. The tumours occur most often in older individuals, usually in the sixth and seventh decades of life, showing a male preponderance in the ratio 2–3:1. As a result of their gross yellow colour and the resemblance of the tumour cells to clear cells of the adrenal cortex, they were at one time called hypernephromas. Tobacco is the most significant risk factor. Cigarette smokers have double the incidence of renal cell carcinoma of non-smokers, and pipe and cigar smokers are also more susceptible. The three classic diagnostic features of renal cell carcinoma are costovertebral pain, palpable mass and haematuria, but these are seen in only 10% of cases. The most reliable of the three is haematuria, but it is usually intermittent and may be microscopic; thus, the tumour may remain silent until it attains a large size. At this time, it gives rise to generalised constitutional symptoms, such as fever, malaise, weakness and weight loss. This pattern of asymptomatic growth occurs in many patients, so the tumour may have reached a diameter of more than 10cm when it is discovered. In current times, however, many of these tumours are being discovered in the asymptomatic state by incidental radiological studies (eg CT or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) usually performed for non-renal indications.

Renal cell carcinoma is classified as one of the great mimics in medicine because it tends to produce a diversity of systemic symptoms not related to the kidney. In addition to the fever and constitutional symptoms mentioned earlier, renal cell carcinomas produce a number of paraneoplastic syndromes, ascribed to abnormal hormone production, including polycythaemia, hypercalcaemia, hypertension, hepatic dysfunction, feminisation or masculinisation, cushing’s syndrome, eosinophilia, leukaemoid reactions and amyloidosis. One of the common characteristics of this tumour is its tendency to metastasise widely before giving rise to any local symptoms or signs. In 25% of new patients with renal cell carcinoma, there is radiological evidence of metastases at the time of presentation. The most common locations of metastasis are the lungs (>50%) and bones (33%), followed in order by the regional lymph nodes, liver and adrenals, and brain.


### Q3.94
The measurement of the serum TSH concentration using sensitive TSH assays provides the most useful single screening test for hyperthyroidism. Which of the following combinations of TSH and T4 levels suggest hyperthyroidism? 

	A. Low TSH, low T4 
	B. High TSH, normal T4 
	C. Normal TSH, low T4 
	D. Low TSH, high T4 
	E. High TSH, high T4
	
#### Answer: D. Low TSH, high T4 - TRUE

The measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration using sensitive TSH (sTSH) assays provides the most useful single screening test for hyperthyroidism, because its levels are decreased even at the earliest stages, when the disease may still be subclinical. A low TSH value is usually confirmed with measurement of free T4, which is expectedly increased. In an occasional patient, hyperthyroidism results predominantly from increased circulating levels of triiodothyronine (T3; ‘T3 toxicosis’). In these cases, free T4 levels may be decreased, and direct measurement of serum T3 may be useful. In rare cases of pituitary-associated (secondary) hyperthyroidism, TSH levels are either normal or raised. Determining TSH levels after the injection of thyroid hormone-releasing hormone (TRH; TRH stimulation test) is used in the evaluation of cases of suspected hyperthyroidism with equivocal changes in the baseline serum TSH level. A normal rise in TSH after administration of TRH excludes secondary hyperthyroidism. Once the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis has been confirmed by a combination of sTSH assays and free thyroid hormone levels, measurement of radioactive iodine uptake by the thyroid gland may be valuable in determining the aetiology, eg there may be diffusely increased uptake in the whole gland (Graves’ disease), increased uptake in a solitary nodule (toxic adenoma) or decreased uptake (thyroiditis).


### Q3.95
Which of the following is a _tumour-suppressor gene_? 

	A. S/S 
	B. INT–2 
	C. HST–1 
	D. HGF 
	E. P53

#### Anser: E. P53 - TRUE

The proteins that apply brakes to cell proliferation are the products of tumour-suppressor genes. In a sense, the term ‘tumour-suppressor genes’ is a misnomer because the physiological function of these genes is to regulate cell growth, not to prevent tumour formation. As the loss of function of these genes is a key event in many, possibly all, human tumours and because their discovery resulted from the study of tumours, the name tumour suppressor persists. The p53 tumour-suppressor gene is located on chromosome 17p13.1, and it is the most common target for genetic alteration in human tumours. A little over 50% of human tumours contain mutations in this gene. Homozygous loss of p53 gene activity can occur in virtually every type of cancer, including carcinomas of the lung, colon and breast – the three leading causes of cancer death. In most cases, the inactivating mutations affect both p53 alleles and are acquired in somatic cells (not inherited in the germline). S/S, INT–2, HST–1 and HGF are all proto-oncogenes.


### Q3.96
Chloride-responsive _metabolic alkalosis_ (urine chloride < 20mmol/L) is seen in:
    
    A. Loss of gastric secretions 
	B. Adrenal adenoma 
	C. Liddle’s syndrome 
	D. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia 
	E. Bartter’s syndrome

#### Answer: D. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia - *FALSE* = A. Loss of gastric secretions - TRUE

Metabolic alkalosis is a primary increase in serum bicarbonate (HCO3–) concentration. This occurs as a consequence of a loss of H+ from the body or a gain in HCO3–. In its pure form, it manifests as alkalaemia (pH >7.40). As a compensatory mechanism, metabolic alkalosis leads to alveolar hypoventilation with a rise in arterial carbon dioxide tension (Paco2), which diminishes the change in pH that would otherwise occur. The most common causes of metabolic alkalosis are the use of diuretics and the external loss of gastric secretions. Causes of metabolic alkalosis can be divided into chloride-responsive alkalosis (urine chloride <20mmol/L), chloride-resistant alkalosis (urine chloride >20mmol/L) and other causes, including alkali-loading alkalosis.

Loss of gastric secretions causes chloride-responsive alkalosis. Gastric secretions are rich in HCI. The secretion of HCI by the stomach usually stimulates bicarbonate secretion by the pancreas once HCI reaches the duodenum. Ordinarily, these substances are neutralised, and no net gain or loss of H+ or HCO3– occurs. When HCI is lost by vomiting or nasogastric suction, pancreatic secretions are not stimulated and a net gain of HCO3– into the systemic circulation occurs, generating a metabolic alkalosis. Volume depletion maintains alkalosis. In this case, the hypokalaemia is secondary to the alkalosis itself and to renal loss of K+ from the stimulation of aldosterone secretion. All other conditions in this question cause chloride-resistant alkalosis (urine chloride >20mmol/L).


### Q3.97
The histopathology report of a patient with _papillary carcinoma of urinary bladder_ indicates _muscularis propria_ invasion with no nodes or distant spread. How would you stage this tumour? 

	A. Stage I 
	B. Stage II 
	C. Stage III 
	D. Stage IV 
	E. Stage 0a 

#### Answer: B. Stage II - TRUE

Approximately 70–80% of patients with newly diagnosed bladder cancer will present with superficial bladder tumours (ie stage Ta, Tis or T1). Those who do present with superficial, non-invasive, bladder cancer can often be cured, and those with deeply invasive disease can sometimes be cured by surgery, irradiation or a combination of modalities that include chemotherapy. The clinical staging of carcinoma of the bladder is determined by the depth of invasion of the bladder wall by the tumour. This determination requires a cystoscopic examination, which includes a biopsy, and examination under anaesthesia to assess the size and mobility of palpable masses, the degree of induration of the bladder wall, and the presence of extravesical extension or invasion of adjacent organs. Clinical staging, even when CT and/or MRI and other imaging modalities are used, often underestimates the extent of the tumour, particularly in cancers that are less differentiated and more deeply invasive.

The American Joint committee on cancer (AJCC) has designated staging by TNM classification to define bladder cancer, as follows.

##### Primary tumour (T)

Class 	| Subclass	| Description |
--------|-----------|-------------|
Tx		| primary tumour cannot be assessed 
T0 		| no evidence of primary tumour
Ta		| non-invasive papillary carcinoma
TIS		| **carcinoma in situ** (i.e. flat tumour)
T1		| tumour invades subepithelial connective tissue
T2		| tumour invades muscle
		| pT2a		| tumour invades superficial muscle (inner half)
		| pT2b		| tumour invades deep muscle (outer half)
T3		| 			| tumour invades perivesical tissue
		| pT3a		| microscopically
		| pT3b		| macroscopically (extravesical mass)
T4		| 			| tumour invades any of the following: prostate, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall or abdominal wall
		| T4a		| tumour invades the prostate, uterus, vagina
		| T4b		| tumour invades the pelvic wall, abdominal wall

- The suffix ‘m’ should be added to the appropriate T category to indicate multiple lesions
- The suffix ‘IS’ may be added to any T to indicate the presence of associated _carcinoma-in-situ_

##### Regional lymph nodes (N)

Class	| Description |
--------|-------------|
Nx		| regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
N0		| no regional lymph node metastasis
N1		| metastasis in a single lymph node, ≤2cm in greatest dimension
N2		| metastasis in a single lymph node, >2cm but ≤5cm in greatest dimension; or multiple lymph nodes, ≤5cm in greatest dimension
N3		| metastasis in a lymph node, >5cm in greatest dimension

##### Distant metastasis (M)

Class	| Description |
--------|-------------|
MX		| Distant metastasis cannot be assessed
M0		| No distant metastasis
M1		| Distant metastasis

##### AJCC stage groupings

Stage		| Classification	|
------------|-------------------|
Stage 0a	| Ta, N0, M0
Stage 0IS	| TIS, N0, M0
Stage I		| T1, N0, M0
Stage II	| T2a, N0, M0
			| T2b, N0, M0
Stage III	| T3a, N0, M0
			| T3b, N0, M0
			| T4a, N0, M0
Stage IV	| T4b, N0, M0
			| Any T, N1, M0
			| Any T, N2, M0
			| Any T, N3, M0
			| Any T, any N, M1

- Thus the patient in this question has stage II disease.


### Q3.98
A 29-year-old woman presents with _weight loss_, _abdominal pain_ and _bloody diarrhoea_. Sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy reveals _mucosal erythema_ and _ulceration extending in a continuous fashion_ proximally from the rectum. 

Which of the following pathological findings would also be characteristic of this patient’s condition? 

	A. Bowel wall thickening 
	B. Fistulae 
	C. Pseudopolyps 
	D. Transmural lesions 
	E. Cobblestone appearance of the mucosa - F

#### Answer: (UC) D. Transmural lesions - *FALSE* = C. Pseudopolyps - TRUE

Feature				|	Ulcerative colitis	| Crohn’s disease	|
--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
Affected age group	| Young to middle age	| Young
Gross bleeding		| Common				| Common
Fistulae			| Rare					| Common
Thickened mesentery	| Rare					| Common
Enlarged mesenteric nodes	| Rare				| Common
Shortening of the colon		| Common			| Rare
Small bowel involvement		| Never				| Common
Thickening of intestinal wall	| Rare		| Common
Strictures						| Never		| Common
Perforation						| Common	| Rare

### Q3.99
The _hypocalcaemia_ in _acute pancreatitis_ reflects: 
    
    A. Gangrenous necrosis 
	B. Caseous necrosis 
	C. Coagulative necrosis 
	D. Enzymatic fat necrosis 
	E. Liquefactive necrosis

#### Answer: B. Caseous necrosis - *FALSE* = D. Enzymatic fat necrosis - TRUE

Acute pancreatitis causes the release of many digestive enzyme precursors, which are then converted to the active form in the damaged tissues. These enzymes degrade the adipose tissue around the pancreatic lobules, producing enzymatic fat necrosis. As part of this process, many free fatty acids are produced that can bind as soaps to extracellular calcium in chemical equilibrium with serum calcium. This often causes a significant decrease in serum calcium levels.


### Q3.100
From a clinical standpoint, tumours of the testis are segregated into two broad categories: seminomas and non-seminomatous germ-cell tumours (NSGCTs). Which of the following statements about NSGCTs is true?

	A. These tumours tend to remain localised to the testis for a long time
	B. These tumours do not metastasise - F
	C. These tumours are radiosensitive
	D. These tumours are less aggressive - F
	E. These tumours have a poorer prognosis

#### Answer: E. These tumours have a poorer prognosis - TRUE

From a clinical standpoint, tumours of the testis are segregated into two broad categories: seminoma and non-seminomatous germ-cell tumours (NSGCTs). NSGCT is an umbrella designation that includes tumours of one histological type, such as embryonal cell carcinoma, as well as those with more than one histological pattern. NSGCTs behave differently from seminoma. Seminomas tend to remain localised to the testis for a long time; hence, about 70% present in clinical stage I.
 
In contrast, about 60% of patients with NSGCTs present with advanced clinical disease (stages II and III). Metastases from seminomas typically involve lymph nodes. Haematogenous spread occurs later in the course of dissemination. NSGCTs not only metastasise earlier but also use the haematogenous route more frequently. The rare pure choriocarcinoma is the most aggressive of the NSGCTs. It might not cause any testicular enlargement but instead spreads predominantly and rapidly via the bloodstream. Therefore, the lungs and liver are involved early in virtually every case. From a therapeutic viewpoint, seminomas are extremely radiosensitive, whereas NSGCTs are relatively radioresistant. To summarise, compared with seminomas, NSGCTs are biologically more aggressive and in general have a poorer prognosis.

### Q3.101
A 45-year-old man who smokes 30 cigarettes a day is diagnosed with a non-small-cell lung cancer. On CT he has a 4cm tumour involving the left upper lobe bronchus, which is >2 cm from the carina. What tumour stage has this man got, according to the TNM staging system?     

	A. TIS (tumour-in-situ)    
	B. T1     
	C. T2     
	D. T3     
	E. T4

#### Answer: A. TIS (tumour-in-situ) - *FALSE* - C. T2 - TRUE

The most important prognostic indicator in lung cancer is the extent of disease. The Union Internationale contre le cancer (UICC) and the AJCC have developed the tumour, node and metastases (TNM) staging system, which takes into account the degree of spread of the primary tumour, the extent of regional lymph node involvement and the presence or absence of distant metastases. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 75% of all lung cancers. NSCLC is subdivided into adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma. Despite their histological and clinical differences, they share a similar prognosis and management and are staged by using the same TNM system. The TNM staging system takes into account: the degree of spread of the primary tumour, represented by T; the extent of regional lymph node involvement, represented by N; and the presence or absence of distant metastases, represented by M. The TNM system is used for all lung carcinomas except small cell lung cancers, which are staged separately. In the TNM systems, the tumour (T) stages are as follows:

- TIS: carcinoma in situ
- Tx: positive malignant cytological findings, no lesion observed
- T1: diameter ≤3cm and surrounded by lung or visceral pleura or endobronchial tumour distal to the lobar bronchus
- T2: diameter >3cm; extension to the visceral pleura, atelectasis or obstructive pneumopathy involving less than one lung; lobar endobronchial tumour; or tumour of a main bronchus >2cm from the carina
- T3: tumour at the apex; total atelectasis of one lung; endobronchial tumour of main bronchus within 2cm of the carina but not invading it; or tumour of any size with direct extension to the adjacent structures such as the chest wall, mediastinal pleura, diaphragm, pericardium parietal layer or mediastinal fat of the phrenic nerve
- T4: invasion of the mediastinal organs, including the oesophagus, trachea, carina, great vessels and/or heart; obstruction of the superior vena cava; involvement of a vertebral body; recurrent nerve involvement; malignant pleural or pericardial effusion; or satellite pulmonary nodules within the same lobe as the primary tumour.

Thus, according to TNM staging the patient in this question has a T2 tumour.

### Q3.102
A 35-year-old man who has been a _heavy smoker_ for the last 18 years complains of _severe pain in both legs_ even at rest and has _chronic ulceration of his toes_. Which of the following conditions is he most likely to have?     

	A. Wegener’s granulomatosis
	B. Buerger’s disease
	C. Kawasaki’s disease
	D. Polyarteritis nodosa
	E. Takayasu’s arteritis

#### Answer: E. Takayasu’s arteritis - *FALSE* = B. Buerger’s disease - TRUE

This patient has Buerger’s disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans. It is a distinctive disease that often leads to vascular insufficiency. It is characterised by segmental, thrombosing, acute and chronic inflammation of medium-sized and small arteries, principally the tibial and radial arteries and sometimes secondarily extending to the veins and nerves of the extremities. Previously a condition that occurred almost exclusively among heavy cigarette-smoking men, Buerger’s disease has been increasingly reported in women, probably reflecting smoking increases among women. The disease begins before age 35 in most cases. Later complications are chronic ulcerations of the toes, feet or fingers, and frank gangrene in some patients. In contrast to atherosclerosis, Buerger’s disease involves smaller arteries and is accompanied by severe pain, even at rest, related undoubtedly to the neural involvement. Abstinence from cigarette smoking in the early stages of the disease often prevents further attacks.

Wegener’s granulomatosis is a necrotising vasculitis characterised by the triad of: (1) acute necrotising granulomata of the upper respiratory tract (ear, nose, sinuses, throat), lower respiratory tract (lung) or both; (2) necrotising or granulomatous vasculitis affecting small to medium-sized vessels (eg capillaries, venules, arterioles and arteries), most prominent in the lungs and upper airways but affecting other sites as well; and (3) renal disease in the form of focal necrotising, often crescentic, glomerulitis.

Kawasaki’s disease is an arteritis that often involves the coronary arteries, usually in young children and infants (80% of cases are younger than 4), and is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in North America and Japan. It is associated with the mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, an acute but usually self-limited illness manifested by fever, conjunctival and oral erythema and erosion, oedema of the hands and feet, erythema of the palms and soles, a skin rash often with desquamation and enlargement of cervical lymph nodes.

Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis of small or mediumsized muscular arteries (but not arterioles, capillaries or venules), typically involving renal and visceral vessels but sparing the pulmonary circulation. Clinical manifestations result from ischaemia and infarction of affected tissues and organs.

Takayasu’s arteritis is a granulomatous vasculitis of medium and larger arteries; described in 1908 by Takayasu, it is characterised principally by ocular disturbances and marked weakening of the pulses in the upper extremities (pulseless disease). The pathological findings that account for the clinical picture are vasculitis and subsequent fibrous thickening of the aorta, particularly the aortic arch and its branches, with narrowing or virtual obliteration of the origins or more distal portions. The illness is seen predominantly in women aged under 40. The cause and pathogenesis are unknown, although autoimmune mechanisms are suspected. A high frequency of the HLA haplotype A24-B52-DR2 has been found in Japanese patients but not in other populations.


### Q3.103
_Hamartomatous polyps_ in the colon are a feature of:     
    
    A. Peutz–Jeghers syndrome     
	B. Familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome
	C. Gardner’s syndrome
	D. Turcot’s syndrome
	E. Lynch’s syndrome

#### Answer: B. Familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome - *FALSE* = A. Peutz–Jeghers syndrome - TRUE

Peutz–Jeghers syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterised by multiple hamartomatous polyps scattered throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract and melanotic mucosal, and cutaneous pigmentation around the lips, oral mucosa, face, genitalia and palmar surfaces of the hands. Patients with this syndrome are at risk for intussusception, which is a common cause of mortality. The Peutz–Jeghers polyps tend to be large and pedunculated with a firm lobulated contour. The distribution of polyps in patients is reported as follows: stomach 25%; colon 30%; and small bowel 100%. Although these hamartomatous polyps themselves do not have malignant potential, patients with the syndrome have an increased risk of developing carcinomas of the pancreas, breast, lung, ovary and uterus. The well-documented and characteristic tumours include sex cord tumours of the ovary, adenoma malignum of the uterine cervix and Sertoli cell tumours of the testis. When gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma occurs, it arises from concomitant adenomatous lesions. The underlying genetic basis for the Peutz–Jeghers syndrome is the mutation of gene STK11 (LKB1) located on chromosome 19. The gene encodes a protein with serine/threonine kinase activity.

All other syndromes are characterised by adenomatous polyps.


### Q3.104
Which of the following is a _seronegative_ spondyloarthropathy?     

	A. Osteoarthritis
	B. Rheumatoid arthritis
	C. Tuberculous arthritis
	D. Lyme arthritis
	E. Psoriatic arthritis

#### Answer: E. Psoriatic arthritis - TRUE

The seronegative spondyloarthropathies are a group of diseases that develop in genetically predisposed individuals and are initiated by environmental factors, especially prior infections or exposures. The manifestations are immune mediated and may be triggered by a T-cell response to unknown antigens. Clinically, the diseases produce inflammatory peripheral or axial arthritis and inflammation of tendinous attachments. The seronegative spondyloarthropathies include ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis (Reiter’s syndrome and enteritis-associated arthritis), psoriatic arthritis and arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, crohn’s disease). They share overlapping clinical features, and many are associated with HLA-B27 and a triggering infection.


### Q3.105
Immediate hypersensitivity reactions involve primary as well as secondary mediators. Which of the following substances is a _secondary mediator of inflammation_?     

	A. Histamine     
	B. Prostaglandin D2     
	C. Chondroitin sulphate     
	D. Chymase     
	E. Tryptase 

#### Answer: B. Prostaglandin D2 - TRUE

Secondary mediators include two classes of compounds: lipid mediators and cytokines. The lipid mediators are generated by sequential reactions in the mast-cell membranes that lead to activation of phospholipase A2, an enzyme that acts on membrane phospholipids to yield arachidonic acid. This is the parent compound from which leukotrienes and prostaglandins are derived by the 5-lipoxygenase and cyclo-oxygenase pathways.

- leukotrienes: leukotrienes LTC4 and LTD4 are the most potent vasoactive and spasmogenic agents known. On a molar basis, they are several thousand times more active than histamine in increasing vascular permeability and causing bronchial smooth muscle contraction. LTB4 is highly chemotactic for neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes.
- Prostaglandin D2: this is the most abundant mediator derived by the cyclo-oxygenase pathway in mast cells. It causes intense bronchospasm as well as increased mucus secretion.
- Platelet-activating factor (PAF): PAF is produced by some mast-cell populations. It causes platelet aggregation, release of histamine, bronchospasm, increased vascular permeability and vasodilatation. In addition, it has important pro-inflammatory actions. PAF is chemotactic for neutrophils and eosinophils. At high concentrations, it activates the newly recruited inflammatory cells, causing them to aggregate and degranulate. As a result of its ability to recruit and activate inflammatory cells, it is considered important in the initiation of the late-phase response. Although the production of PAF is also triggered by the activation of phospholipase A2, it is not a product of arachidonic acid metabolism.
- cytokines: mast cells are sources of many cytokines, which play an important role in the late-phase reaction of immediate hypersensitivity because of their ability to recruit and activate inflammatory cells. The cytokines include TNF, IL-1, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and GM-CSF (granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor), as well as chemokines, such as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1a and MIP-1β . Mast cell-derived TNF and chemokines are important mediators of the inflammatory response seen at the site of allergic inflammation. Inflammatory cells that accumulate at the sites of type I hypersensitivity reactions are additional sources of cytokines and histamine-releasing factors that cause further mast-cell degranulation.


### Q3.106
The appendicectomy specimen from a 64-year-old woman was sent for histology because there was a suspicion that the bulbous swelling in the tip may be a carcinoid tumour. The histology report confirmed the diagnosis. 

Which of the following statements about carcinoid tumours of the appendix is **correct**?     

	A. The appendix is the most common site of gut carcinoid tumours     
	B. All appendiceal carcinoids are symptomatic - F
	C. Of appendiceal carcinoids, 90% metastasise - F   
	D. All appendiceal carcinoids are associated with carcinoid syndrome - F
	E. The overall 5-year survival rate for carcinoid tumours is less than 20%

#### Answer: A. The appendix is the most common site of gut carcinoid tumours - TRUE

Carcinoid tumour is derived from resident endocrine cells, with the gastrointestinal tract and lung as the predominant sites of occurrence. The peak incidence of these neoplasms is in the sixth decade, but they may appear at any age. They comprise less than 2% of colorectal malignancies but almost half of small intestinal malignant tumours. The appendix is the most common site of gut carcinoid tumours, followed by the small intestine (primarily ileum), rectum, stomach and colon. However, the rectal tumours may represent up to half of tumours that come to clinical attention. Those that arise in the stomach and ileum are frequently multicentric, but the remainder tend to be solitary lesions. In the appendix they appear as bulbous swellings of the tip, which frequently obliterate the lumen. Elsewhere in the gut, they appear as intramural or submucosal masses that create small, polypoid or plateau-like elevations rarely >3cm in diameter.

Gastrointestinal carcinoids only rarely produce local symptoms, which are caused by angulation or obstruction of the small intestine. Many (especially rectal and appendiceal) are asymptomatic and found incidentally. Appendiceal and rectal carcinoids infrequently metastasise, even though they may show extensive local spread. By contrast, 90% of ileal, gastric and colonic carcinoids that have penetrated halfway through the muscle wall have spread to lymph nodes and distant sites such as the liver at the time of diagnosis. This is especially true for tumours >2cm in diameter. Carcinoid syndrome occurs in about 1% of all patients with carcinoids and in 20% of those with widespread metastases. The overall 5-year survival rate for carcinoids (excluding appendiceal) is about 90%. Even with small-bowel tumours with hepatic metastases, it is better than 50%. However, widespread disease will usually cause death.


### Q3.107
_Primary gastrointestinal lymphomas_ usually arise as sporadic neoplasms but also occur more frequently in certain patient populations. Which of the following patient populations is _least likely_ to have _primary gastrointestinal lymphomas_?     

	A. Chronic gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori
    B. Chronic sprue-like syndromes     
	C. Native inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa     
	D. Congenital immunodeficiency states 
	E. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

#### Answer: E. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - *FALSE* = C. Native inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa - TRUE

Up to 40% of lymphomas arise in sites other than lymph nodes, and the gut is the most common location. Conversely, about 1–4% of all gastrointestinal malignancies are lymphomas. By definition, primary gastrointestinal lymphomas exhibit no evidence of liver, spleen, mediastinal lymph node or bone marrow involvement at the time of diagnosis – regional lymph node involvement may be present. 

Primary gastrointestinal lymphomas usually arise as sporadic neoplasms but also occur more frequently in certain patient populations:

- chronic gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori
- chronic sprue-like syndromes
- Natives of the Mediterranean region
- congenital immunodeficiency states
- Infection with HIV
- After organ transplantation with immunosuppression.
 

### Q3.108
A 35-year-old woman with _progressive weakness_ and easy fatiguability for the last 6 months is seen in the Emergency Department complaining of anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss and diarrhoea of 1 month’s duration. On examination she is noticed to have hypotension and hyperpigmentation of the skin. Laboratory tests show _hyperkalaemia_, _hyponatraemia_ and _hypoglycaemia_. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?     

	A. Hypothyroidism
	B. Addison’s disease
	C. SIADH
	D. Diabetes insipidus
	E. Primary hyperaldosteronism

#### Answer: B. Addison’s disease - TRUE

The clinical features and laboratory investigations are suggestive of Addison’s disease. Addison’s disease begins insidiously and does not come to attention until at least 90% of the cortex of both glands is destroyed and the levels of circulating glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are significantly decreased. The initial manifestations include progressive weakness and easy fatiguability, which may be dismissed as non-specific complaints.

Gastrointestinal disturbances are common and include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss and diarrhoea. In patients with primary adrenal disease, increased circulating levels of the ACTH precursor hormone stimulate melanocytes, with resultant hyperpigmentation of the skin, particularly of sun-exposed areas and at pressure points, such as the neck, elbows, knees and knuckles. Decreased mineralocorticoid activity in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency results in potassium retention and sodium loss, with consequent hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, volume depletion and hypotension. Hypoglycaemia may occasionally occur as a result of glucocorticoid deficiency and impaired gluconeogenesis. Stresses such as infections, trauma or surgical procedures in such patients can precipitate an acute adrenal crisis, manifested by intractable vomiting, abdominal pain, hypotension, coma and vascular collapse. Death occurs rapidly unless corticosteroid therapy begins immediately. More than 90% of all cases are attributable to one of four disorders: autoimmune adrenalitis, TB, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or metastatic cancers.


### Q3.109
Which of the following drugs exerts a _protective effect_ against _colon cancer_?     

	A. Methotrexate 
	B. Cyclophosphamide 
	C. Tamoxifen
	D. Etoposide
	E. Aspirin

#### Answer: A. Methotrexate - *FALSE* = E. Aspirin - TRUE

Several epidemiological studies suggest that the use of aspirin and other NSAIDs exerts a protective effect against colon cancer. In the Nurses’ Health Study, women who used four to six tablets of aspirin/ day for 10 years or more had a decreased incidence of colon cancer. Two recent studies have revealed that aspirin reduces the risk of recurrent adenomas in patients with previous colorectal carcinomas or adenomas. The mechanism of such chemoprevention is not fully understood, but it is probably mediated by inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). This enzyme is over-expressed in neoplastic epithelium and seems to regulate angiogenesis and apoptosis. On the basis of these findings, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of COX-2 inhibitors as chemopreventive agents in patients with the familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome.


### Q3.110
Povidone–iodine surgical scrub is used as an antiseptic skin cleanser for preoperative scrubbing and washing by surgeons and theatre staff and preoperative preparation of patients’ skin. Which of the following statements about povidone–iodine is __true__?     

	A. It is a quaternary ammonium compound
	B. It acts by disrupting the bacterial cell wall
	C. It is bacteriostatic - F
	D. It is active against spore-forming organisms
	E. It acts by denaturing proteins - F

#### Answer: D. It is active against spore-forming organisms - TRUE

Povidone–iodine is iodine complexed with povidone (polyvinylpyrrolidone). The compound is soluble in water, forming a golden-brown solution. Similar to iodine, the solution of the iodine complex is bactericidal and fungicidal. However, unlike solutions of iodine, it is non-staining. The antiseptic action of povidone–iodine solutions is the result of the available iodine present in the complex. It acts by oxidation/substitution of free iodine.

### Q3.111
A 48-year-old man notices a lump in the subcutaneous tissue in his left thigh. The lesion is removed. He is very relieved to learn that it is benign. 

Which of the following characteristics of this lesion would tend to point towards a benign neoplasm rather than a malignant one?     

	A. Infiltration of the surrounding tissues - F
	B. Well-defined encapsulation
	C. Prominent mitotic figures - F
	D. Anaplasia
	E. Metastasis - F

#### Answer: D. Anaplasia - *FALSE* = B. Well-defined encapsulation - TRUE

The term ‘benign’ refers to a tumour, condition or growth that is not cancerous. This means that it is localised and has not spread to other parts of the body or invaded and destroyed nearby tissue. In general, a benign tumour is usually not harmful and benign tumours usually grow slowly and are well encapsulated and well differentiated. They can usually be removed and in most cases they do not recur. However, if a benign tumour is big enough, the size and weight can press on nearby organs, blood vessels and nerves and thus cause problems.

Malignant neoplasms, in contrast, range from well differentiated to undifferentiated. Malignant neoplasms composed of undifferentiated cells are said to be anaplastic. Lack of differentiation, or anaplasia, is considered a hallmark of malignant transformation. Anaplasia literally means ‘to form backward’, implying a reversion from a high level of differentiation to a lower level. Lack of differentiation, or anaplasia, is marked by the following:

•    Pleomorphism: both the cells and the nuclei characteristically display pleomorphism – variation in size and shape. Cells may be found that are many times larger than their neighbours, and other cells may be extremely small and appear primitive.
•    Abnormal nuclear morphology: characteristically the nuclei contain an abundance of DNA and are extremely dark staining (hyperchromatic). The nuclei are disproportionately large for the cell, and the nucleus: cytoplasm ratio may approach 1:1 instead of the normal 1:4 or 1:6. The nuclear shape is very variable, and the chromatin is often coarsely clumped and distributed along the nuclear membrane. Large nucleoli are usually present in these nuclei.
•    Mitoses: compared with benign tumours and some well-differentiated malignant neoplasms, undifferentiated tumours usually possess large numbers of mitoses, reflecting the higher proliferative activity of the parenchymal cells. The presence of mitoses does not, however, necessarily indicate that a tumour is malignant or that the tissue is neoplastic. Many normal tissues exhibiting rapid turnover, such as bone marrow, have numerous mitoses, and non-neoplastic proliferations such as hyperplasias contain many cells in mitosis. More important as a morphological feature of malignant neoplasia are atypical, bizarre mitotic figures, sometimes producing tripolar, quadripolar or multipolar spindles.
•    loss of polarity: in addition to the cytological abnormalities, the orientation of anaplastic cells is markedly disturbed (ie they lose normal polarity). Sheets or large masses of tumour cells grow in an anarchic, disorganised fashion.
•    other changes: another feature of anaplasia is the formation of tumour giant cells, some possessing only a single huge polymorphic nucleus and others having two or more nuclei. These giant cells are not to be confused with inflammatory langhans’ or foreign body giant cells, which are derived from macrophages and contain many small, normal-appearing nuclei. In the cancer giant cell, the nuclei are hyperchromatic and large in relation to the cell.

Last but not least malignant tumours are locally invasive and frequently metastasise.


### Q3.112
A few weeks after an episode of _group A streptococcal pharyngitis_, a 12-year-old boy develops acute _rheumatic fever_. During the acute phase of the rheumatic fever, the characteristic inflammatory lesions found in his heart are known as:     
    
    A. Ferruginous bodies
	B. Foamy macrophages
	C. Langhans’ giant cells
	D. Pyogenic granuloma
	E. Aschoff’s bodies

#### Answer: C. Langhans’ giant cells - *FALSE* = E. Aschoff’s bodies - TRUE

Rheumatic fever (RF) is an acute, immunologically mediated, multisystem inflammatory disease that occurs a few weeks after an episode of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Acute rheumatic carditis during the active phase of RF may progress to chronic rheumatic heart disease. The most important consequence of RF is chronic valvular deformities, characterised principally by deforming fibrotic valvular disease (particularly mitral stenosis), which produces permanent dysfunction and severe, sometimes fatal, cardiac problems decades later. During acute RF, focal inflammatory lesions are found in various tissues. They are most distinctive within the heart, where they are called Aschoff’s bodies. They consist of foci of swollen eosinophilic collagen surrounded by lymphocytes (primarily T cells), occasional plasma cells and plump macrophages called Anitschkow’s cells (pathognomonic for RF). These distinctive cells have abundant cytoplasm and central round-to-ovoid nuclei in which the chromatin is disposed in a central, slender, wavy ribbon (hence the designation ‘caterpillar cells’). Some of the larger macrophages become multinucleated to form Aschoff’s giant cells. During acute RF, diffuse inflammation and Aschoff’s bodies may be found in any of the three layers of the heart – pericardium, myocardium or endocardium – hence the lesion’s name pancarditis. In the pericardium, the inflammation is accompanied by a fibrinous or serofibrinous pericardial exudate, described as a ‘bread-and-butter’ pericarditis, which generally resolves without sequelae. The myocardial involvement – myocarditis – takes the form of scattered Aschoff’s bodies within the interstitial connective tissue, often perivascular.

Ferruginous bodies are iron-coated asbestos particles seen in pulmonaryasbestosis.Foamymacrophagesarelipid-ladenmacrophages seen in an atherosclerotic plaque and are not seen in rheumatic fever. Langhans’ giant cells are seen in tuberculous granuloma. Pyogenic granuloma is a polypoid form of capillary haemangioma that occurs as a rapidly growing exophytic red nodule attached by a stalk to the skin and gingival or oral mucosa.


### Q3.113
Which of the following interleukins is involved in _B-cell, T-cell and natural killer (NK)_ cell _survivial, development and homeostasis_?

	A. IL-1
	B. IL-2
	C. IL-3
	D. IL-7
	E. IL-8

#### Answer: B. IL-2 - *FALSE* = D. IL-7 - TRUE

The induction and regulation of immune responses involve multiple interactions among lymphocytes, monocytes, inflammatory cells (eg neutrophils) and endothelial cells. Many such interactions depend on cell-to-cell contact; however, many interactions and effector functions are mediated by short-acting soluble mediators, called cytokines. This term includes the previously designated lymphokines (lymphocyte derived), monokines (monocyte derived) and several other polypeptides that regulate immunological, inflammatory and reparative host responses. Molecularly defined cytokines are called interleukins, implying that they mediate communications between leukocytes. Most cytokines have a wide spectrum of effects and some are produced by several different cell types. The following list provides the major effects of various interleukins:

•    IL-1: secreted by macrophages; induces acute-phase reaction
•    IL-2: secreted by T cells, stimulates growth and differentiation of T-cell response; potential for immunotherapy to treat cancer
•    IL-3: secreted by T cells, stimulates bone marrow stem cells
•    IL-4: involved in proliferation of B cells, and the development of T cells and mast cells; important role in allergic responses
•    IL-5: role in stimulation of B cells, eosinophil production and IgA production
•    IL-6: secreted by macrophages; induces acute-phase reaction
•    IL-7: involved in B-, T- and NK (natural killer) cell survival, development and homeostasis
•    IL-8: neutrophil chemotaxis
•    IL-9: stimulates mast cells
•    IL-10: inhibits Th1 (T-helper type 1 cell) cytokine production
•    IL-11: acute-phase protein production
•    IL-12: NK cell stimulation; Th1 cell induction
•    IL-13: stimulates growth and differentiation of B cells, inhibits Th1 cells and the production of macrophage inflammatory cytokines
•    IL-17: induces production of inflammatory cytokines
•    IL-18: induces production of interferon-γ.


### Q3.114
The full blood count of a 35-year-old woman with respiratory complaints shows neutrophilic leukocytosis. Which of the following is associated with neutrophilic leukocytosis?

	A. Hay fever - F
	B. Asthma - F
	C. Streptococcal pneumonia
	D. _Ascaris_ infection
	E. Loeffler's syndrome

#### Answer: C. Streptococcal pneumonia - TRUE

A leukocytosis is an increase in the number of circulating leukocytes. A neutrophilic leukocytosis (neutrophilia) typically occurs in response to acute bacterial infections, especially those caused by pyogenic organisms, eg streptococcal pneumonia. It is also seen in sterile inflammation caused by, for example, tissue necrosis (myocardial infarction, burns). All of the other conditions listed are associated with eosinophilia. The most common causes of eosinophilia are allergic diseases and parasitic infections. The parasitic infections that are associated with eosinophilia involve invasion of the tissues. In addition, there are several other causes of eosinophilia. The mnemonic for eosinophilia is ‘worms, wheezes and weird diseases’. Hay fever and asthma are both caused by a type I immune injury (IgE mediated), in which eosinophilia occurs. Ascaris species cause a parasitic tissue infection (non-respiratory). ‘Weird diseases’ refers to a wide array of other conditions, including Hodgkin’s disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, loeffler’s syndrome, pemphigus and dermatitis herpetiformis.


### Q3.115
A sputum sample collected from a 65-year-old man with lobar pneumonia was subjected to a Gram-staining technique. _Gram-positive_, _capsulated_, _flame-shaped diplococci_ were seen when the stained smear was examined under the microscope. Sputum culture on blood agar revealed dome-shaped, centrally umbilicated colonies with evidence of a haemolysis. The organism causing the infection is likely to be:     

	A. Streptococcus pneumoniae
	B. Staphylococcus aureus
	C. Mycoplasma pneumoniae
	D. Klebsiella pneumoniae
	E. Corynebacterium diphtheriae

#### Answer: D. Klebsiella pneumoniae - *FALSE* = A. Streptococcus pneumoniae - TRUE

- Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive organism that is flame shaped and seen characteristically as diplococci (ie in pairs) and capsulated. The organism grows on blood agar to form dome-shaped, centrally umbilicated colonies and produces a haemolysis of the RBCs.
- Staphylococcus aureus is not the correct answer because it is typically seen in clusters under the microscope when Gram stained and also its colonies are raised and not dome shaped. It produces haemolysis on blood agar rather than a haemolysis.
- Klebsiella pneumoniae is also unlikely because it is a Gram-negative rather than a Gram-positive organism. It will be seen under the microscope as rods rather then cocci.
- Corynebacterium diphtheriae causes only an upper respiratory tract infection. It does not cause pneumonia so it cannot be brought up in the sputum.
- Mycoplasma pneumoniae can cause pneumonia but is incorrect because it does not take up Gram stain and also does not grow on blood agar.


### Q3.116
A 60-year-old man with obstructive jaundice is diagnosed with infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Which of the following statements about this tumour is true?

	A. About 60% of cancers of the pancreas arise in the body of the gland - F
	B. The APC gene is the most frequently altered oncogene in pancreatic cancer - F    
	C. Carcinomas of the pancreas present very early with obstructive jaundice - F    
	D. More than 50% of pancreatic cancers overall are resectable at the time of - Fdiagnosis     
	E. The 5-year survival rate is less than 5%

#### Answer: E. The 5-year survival rate is less than 5% - TRUE

Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, more commonly known as ‘pancreatic cancer,’ is primarily a disease in elderly people, 80% of cases occurring between the ages of 60 and 80. It is more common in black than in white individuals, and it is slightly more common in individuals of Jewish decent. The strongest environmental influence is smoking, which is believed to double the risk of pancreatic cancer. Other associated aetiological factors include alcohol, chronic pancreatitis, consumption of a diet rich in fats and diabetes mellitus. About 60% of cancers of the pancreas arise in the head of the gland, 15% in the body and 5% in the tail; in 20%, the neoplasm diffusely involves the entire gland. The K-RAS gene (chromosome 12p) is the most frequently altered oncogene in pancreatic cancer. This oncogene is activated by point mutation in 80–90% of pancreatic cancers.

Carcinomas of the pancreas remain silent until their extension impinges on some other structure. Pain is usually the first symptom, but by the time pain appears these cancers are usually beyond cure. Obstructive jaundice is associated with most cases of carcinoma of the head of the pancreas, but it rarely draws attention to the invasive cancer soon enough. Weight loss, anorexia, and generalised malaise and weakness tend to be signs of advanced disease. Migratory thrombophlebitis, known as Trousseau’s sign, occurs in about 10% of patients and is attributable to the elaboration of platelet-aggregating factors and pro-coagulants from the tumour or its necrotic products. Despite the tendency of lesions of the head of the pancreas to obstruct the biliary system, less than 20% of pancreatic cancers overall are resectable at the time of diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate is dismal, <5%.


### Q3.117
A 65-year-old man underwent right hemicolectomy for a carcinoma involving the ascending colon. Preoperative assessment showed no evidence of metastatic spread. The resected specimen along with lymph nodes in the mesentery was sent for histopathology reporting. The report received a week later read: the specimen of large bowel on gross examination had a polypoid, exophytic mass that extends along one wall of the capacious caecum and ascending colon for about 6cm. On microscopy the adenocarcinoma is extending into the _muscularis propria_ but not penetrating through it. Five of the seven nodes in mesentery have metastatic deposits. Using the TNM staging system what would you stage this tumour as?     

	A. Stage IIA     
	B. Stage IIB
	C. Stage IIIA
	D. Stage IIIB
	E. Stage IIIC
	
#### Answer: D. Stage IIIB - *FALSE* = E. Stage IIIC - TRUE

More than one system is used for staging colorectal cancer. These include Dukes’, Astler–coller and AJCC/TNM systems. The AJCC system (also called the TNM system) describes stages using Roman numerals I–IV. Both Dukes’ system and the Astler–coller system use A–c; the Astler–coller system adds stage D and has more subdivisions.
The AJCC/TNM system describes the extent of the primary tumour (T), the absence or presence of metastasis to nearby lymph nodes (N), and the absence or presence of distant metastasis (M).

##### T categories for colorectal cancer
 
T categories of colorectal cancer describe the extent of spread through the layers that form the wall of the colon and rectum. These layers, from the inner to the outer, include the lining (mucosa), the fibrous tissue beneath this muscle layer (submucosa), a thick layer of muscle that contracts to force the contents of the intestines along (muscularis propria) and the thin outermost layers of connective tissue (subserosa and serosa) that cover most of the colon but not the rectum.
 
Tx:	no description of the tumour’s extent is possible because of incomplete information.
TIS:	the cancer is in the earliest stage. It has not grown beyond the mucosa (inner layer) of the colon or rectum. This stage is also known as carcinoma in situ or intramucosal carcinoma.
T1:	the cancer has grown through the mucosa and extends into the submucosa.
T2:	the cancer has grown through the submucosa and extends into the muscularis propria.
T3:	the cancer has grown completely through the muscularis propria into the subserosa, but not to any neighbouring organs or tissues.
T4:	the cancer has spread completely through the wall of the colon or rectum into nearby tissues or organs.

##### N categories for colorectal cancer
 
N categories indicate whether or not the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and, if so, how many lymph nodes are involved.

Nx:	no description of lymph node involvement is possible because of incomplete information.
N0:	no lymph node involvement is found.
N1:	cancer cells found in one to three nearby lymph nodes.
N2:	cancer cells found in four or more nearby lymph nodes.

##### M categories for colorectal cancer
 
M categories indicate whether or not the cancer has spread to distant organs, such as the liver, lungs or distant lymph nodes.
 
Mx:	no description of distant spread is possible because of incomplete information.
M0:	no distant spread is seen.
M1:	distant spread is present.

##### Stage grouping

Once a patient’s T, N and M categories have been determined, usually after surgery, this information is combined in a process called stage grouping to determine the stage, expressed in Roman numerals from stage I (the least advanced stage) to stage IV (the most advanced stage). The following guide illustrates how TNM categories are grouped together into stages:
Stage 0 (TIS N0 M0): the cancer is in the earliest stage. It has not grown beyond the inner layer (mucosa) of the colon or rectum. This stage is also known as carcinoma in situ or intramucosal carcinoma.
Stage I (T1 N0 M0, or T2 N0 M0): the cancer has grown through the mucosa into the submucosa or it may also have grown into the muscularis propria, but it has not spread into nearby lymph nodes or distant sites.
Stage IIA (T3 N0 M0): the cancer has grown through the wall of the colon or rectum into the outermost layers. It has not yet spread to the nearby lymph nodes or distant sites.
Stage IIB (T4 N0 M0): the cancer has grown through the wall of the colon or rectum into other nearby tissues or organs. It has not yet spread to the nearby lymph nodes or distant sites.
Stage IIIA (T1–2 N1 M0): the cancer has grown through the mucosa into the submucosa or it may also have grown into the muscularis propria, and it has spread to one to three nearby lymph nodes but not distant sites.
Stage IIIB (T3–4 N1 M0): the cancer has grown through the wall of the colon or rectum or into other nearby tissues or organs and has spread to one to three nearby lymph nodes but not distant sites.
Stage IIIC (any T N2 M0): the cancer can be any T but has spread to four or more nearby lymph nodes but not distant sites.
Stage IV (any T any N M1): the cancer can be any T, any N, but has spread to distant sites such as the liver, lung, peritoneum (the membrane lining the abdominal cavity) or ovary.
As the patient in this scenario has got more than four nodes (N2) but no distant metastases he has stage IIIC disease.


### Q3.118
Monoclonal antibodies are used to detect serum antigens associated with specific malignancies. These tumour markers are most useful for monitoring response to therapy and detecting early relapse. 

Which of the following tumour markers is used to follow response to therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer?     

	A. CEA
	B. CA-27.29
	C. CA-19-9
	D. CA-125
	E. AFP

#### Answer: B. CA-27.29 - TRUE

Cancer antigen (CA)-27.29 is a monoclonal antibody to a glycoprotein (MUC1) that is present on the apical surface of normal epithelial cells. CA-27.29 is highly associated with breast cancer, although levels are elevated in several other malignancies including colon, gastric, hepatic, lung, pancreatic, ovarian and prostate cancers. It also can be found in patients with benign disorders of the breast, liver and kidney, and in patients with ovarian cysts. However, CA-27.29 levels higher than 100-U/ml are rare in benign conditions. As a result of superior sensitivity and specificity, CA-27.29 has supplanted CA-15-3 as the preferred tumour marker in breast cancer. The CA-27.29 level is elevated in about a third of women with early stage breast cancer (stage I or II) and in two-thirds of women with late-stage disease (stage III or IV). CA-27.29 lacks predictive value in the earliest stages of breast cancer and thus has no role in screening for or diagnosing the malignancy. However, it is used most frequently to follow the response to therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. One trial in patients at high risk for recurrence of breast cancer (stage II or III) found that CA-27.29 was highly specific and sensitive in detecting preclinical metastasis. The average time from initial elevation of CA-27.29 to onset of symptoms was 5 months. As CA-27.29 testing may lead to prompt imaging of probable sites of metastasis, it may be possible to decrease morbidity through earlier institution of therapy.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), an oncofetal glycoprotein, is expressed in normal mucosal cells and over-expressed in adenocarcinoma, especially colorectal cancer. CEA elevations also occur with other malignancies. Non-neoplastic conditions associated with elevated CEA levels include cigarette smoking, peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, hypothyroidism, biliary obstruction and cirrhosis. Levels >10ng/ml are rarely caused by benign disease.
Elevated levels of CA-19-9, an intracellular adhesion molecule, occur primarily in patients with pancreatic and biliary tract cancers but have also been reported in patients with other malignancies. This tumour marker has a sensitivity and specificity of 80–90% for pancreatic cancer and a sensitivity of 60–70% for biliary tract cancer. Benign conditions such as cirrhosis, cholestasis, cholangitis and pancreatitis also result in CA-19-9 elevations, although values are usually <1000U/ml.

CA-125 is a glycoprotein normally expressed in coelomic epithelium during fetal development. This epithelium lines body cavities and envelopes the ovaries. Elevated CA-125 values are most often associated with epithelial ovarian cancer, although levels can also be increased in other malignancies. CA-125 levels are elevated in about 85% of women with ovarian cancer, but only 50% of those with stage I disease. Higher levels are associated with increasing bulk of disease and are highest in tumours with non-mucinous histology. AFP is the major protein of fetal serum but falls to an undetectable level after birth. The primary malignancies associated with AFP elevations are hepatocellular carcinoma and non-seminomatous germ cell tumours. Other gastrointestinal cancers occasionally cause elevations of AFP, but rarely to >1000ng/ml.


### Q3.119
Immediately after elective right hemicolectomy the catabolic phase is characterised by:     

	A. Increased metabolic demands     
	B. Mobilisation of glucose to serve as a substrate for gluconeogenesis - F
	C. Decreased urinary nitrogen excretion - F
	D. Decreased fatty acid oxidation - F
	E. Increased response to insulin - F

#### Answer: A. Increased metabolic demands - TRUE

The catabolic phase immediately follows an insult and may last from 3 to 8 days after uncomplicated elective surgery. After severe stress, such as multiple trauma or thermal injury, this phase may persist for weeks. The catabolic phase is governed by the classic sympathoadrenal response. In the immediate period after an insult, metabolic demands increase and there is a mobilisation of protein to serve as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Resting energy expenditure may increase dramatically depending on the severity of the insult. Urinary nitrogen excretion increases to levels greater than those seen in simple starvation and may exceed 20g/day. Lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation are also increased. The normal response to insulin is lost and the patient becomes insulin resistant. The normal response of skeletal muscle to insulin is decreased by up to 50%.


### Q3.120
Synovial fluid analysis is commonly performed to determine the cause of acute arthritis. Which of the following synovial fluid analysis findings is correctly associated with the causative lesion?     

	A. High viscosity in tuberculous arthritis     
	B. Turbid appearance in rheumatoid arthritis     
	C. Thin, needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals in pseudogout     
	D. 200–2000 white blood cells/mm3 in osteoarthritis     
	E. >75% polymorphonuclear leukocytes in psoriatic arthritis

#### Answer: C. Thin, needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals in pseudogout - *FALSE* = 	D. 200–2000 white blood cells/mm3 in osteoarthritis - TRUE

Synovial fluid analysis is commonly performed to determine the cause of acute arthritis. It is of critical importance in establishing the diagnosis of septic arthritis and can be important in establishing a diagnosis of crystal-induced arthritis such as gout or pseudogout. The table below presents synovial fluid analysis findings in some common disorders causing arthritis.

##### Examination of synovial fluid

a>75% are polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
bThe urate crystals in gout are thin, needle-shaped and negatively birefringent.
cThe CPPD (calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate) crystals in pseudogout are rhomboid, often short and variable in shape, with weakly positive birefringence.
