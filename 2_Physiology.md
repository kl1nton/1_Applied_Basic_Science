Questions 2.1-2.10
------------------

70% - F: 5, 6, 7

### Q2.1
A 63-year-old man’s blood pressure was high as he wrongly omitted taking his antihypertensive medication on the day of surgery. An _increase in systemic blood pressure_ leads to which one of the following effects?

	A. A decrease in the maximal wall tension in the left ventricle
	B. A decrease in the time it takes for the left ventricular wall to develop peak tension
	C. An increase in cardiac output
	D. An increase in the residual volume of blood in the left ventricle
	E. An increase in the velocity at which blood is ejected from the left ventricle

#### Answer: D. An increase in the residual volume of blood in the left ventricle - TRUE
- An increase in systemic pressure (i.e. afterload that ventricle must overcome) 
	- reduces velocity of shortening of contractile elements in the muscle
- An increase in afterload also reduces extent of muscle shortening
	- resulting in &darr; stroke volume (SO), and  
	- consequently &uarr; residual volume (i.e. volume of blood left in ventricles at end of ejection)
- Time that it takes for left ventricular (LV) wall to develop peak tension is not reduced 
	- As velocity of contraction is reduced and peak tension is increased
- Wall tension is a function of product of ventricular pressure and volume
- Because pressure and volume are increased
	- Wall tension *also* is increased in presence of an increased afterload

### Q2.2
A 26-year-old man involved in road traffic accident is brought to the Emergency Department with considerable blood loss from his fractured right femur. He is given transfusion to increase the preload of the cardiac muscle. Increasing the _preload_:

	A. Decreases the initial velocity of shortening of the cardiac muscle
	B. Decreases the time it takes the muscle to reach peak tension
	C. Increases the ventricular wall tension
	D. Reduces the peak tension of the muscle
	E. Reduces the ventricular end-diastolic pressure

#### Answer: C. Increases the ventricular wall tension - TRUE
- Increasing the cardiac muscle preload increases the ventricular wall tension. An increase in both end-diastolic pressure and volume is synonymous with an increased preload. The increased preload causes a more forceful ventricular contraction, which results in an increase in the peak pressure generated by the ventricle as well as an increase in the stroke volume. This intrinsic property of the myocardium is termed the Frank Starling mechanism. The increased preload results in an increased velocity of shortening, but because the peak pressure increases, the time to peak pressure usually remains constant under these conditions.

### Q2.3
A 22-year-old athlete is running the London marathon. Which one of the following mechanisms is the _most important for maintaining increased blood flow_ to this athlete’s skeletal muscles?

	A. An increase in aortic pressure
	B. An increase in -adrenergic impulses
	C. An increase in -adrenergic impulses
	D. Vasoconstriction in the splanchnic and renal areas
	E. Vasodilation secondary to the effects of local metabolites

#### Answer: E. Vasodilation secondary to the effects of local metabolites - TRUE
- Vasodilation in active skeletal muscles, prompted by the release of metabolic products from the muscle tissue, reduces the resistance to flow and results in an increased blood flow to the involved tissues. The increase in blood flow is dependent on maintaining the mean arterial blood pressure, which usually rises only slightly with exercise. Thus, the slight rise in arterial blood pressure coupled with a significant rise in blood flow indicates that the total vascular resistance must decline during exercise. The decrease in vascular resistance occurs because skeletal muscle represents approximately 50% of total body weight in the normal adult. Therefore, a decrease in this tissue can more than compensate for the increased resistance in tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skin during periods of mild to moderate exercise.

### Q2.4
A patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoes measurement of his lung volumes and capacities prior to undergoing major abdominal surgery. The volume of gas in his lungs at the end of a normal expiration is referred to as the:

	A. Expiratory reserve volume (ERV)
	B. Functional residual capacity (FRC)
	C. Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV)
	D. Residual volume (RV)
	E. Total lung capacity (TLC)
	
#### Answer: B. Functional residual capacity (FRC) - TRUE
- The functional residual capacity (FRC) is the volume of gas in the lungs at the end of normal expiration. Since expiration is passive, the lung volume decreases during expiration until the equilibrium volume (ie, the FRC) is reached. The equilibrium volume represents the volume of a distensible structure when the transmural pressure (ie, the pressure inside minus the pressure outside) is zero. The residual volume is the volume of gas in the lungs following maximal expiration. The expiratory reserve volume is the volume of gas that can be forcefully expired after normal expiration, and the inspiratory reserve volume is the additional volume gas that can be inspired over the tidal volume. The total lung capacity is the volume of gas in the lungs after maximal inspiration.

### Q2.5
Following extubation, ABG analysis of a patient showed raised PaCO2 levels. _HyPERcapnia affects respiration_ primarily by stimulating the:

	A. Arterial baroreceptors
	B. Carotid and aortic bodies
	C. Central (medullary) chemoreceptors
	D. Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)
	E. J receptors
	
#### Answer: B. Carotid and aortic bodies - *FALSE* = C. Central (medullary) chemoreceptors - TRUE
- 85% of the effect of CO2 on respiratory drive is mediated through central (*medullary*) chemoreceptors
	- Only 15% of the effect comes from carotid and aortic bodies (*peripheral chemoreceptors*)
- CO2 readily crosses blood–brain barrier, but charged ions (ie, H+) do not
- Hydration and subsequent dissociation of CO2 into H+ and HCO3– after it crosses the blood– brain barrier 
	- &uarr; H+ concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissues stimulating respiration
- J receptors, arterial baroreceptors, and hypoglossal nerve are **not** affected by changes in CO2

### Q2.6
A 47-year-old man who is breathing air at sea level has a respiratory exchange ratio of 1. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals: pH = 7.52, PaO2 = *85 mmHg* (11.3 kPa), and PaCO2 = *30 mmHg* (4.0 kPa). This patient’s *arterial blood gas* analysis is suggestive of which one of the following?

	A. He has been hypoventilating
	B. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
	C. He has metabolic alkalosis
	D. His alveolar-to-arterial O2 tension difference exceeds 20 mmHg
	E. His plasma bicarbonate levels are increased

#### Answer: E. His plasma bicarbonate levels are increased - *FALSE* = D. His alveolar-to-arterial O2 tension difference exceeds 20 mmHg - TRUE
- pH: alkalotic; PaO2: normal; PaCO2: **LOW** = Respiratory Alkalosis
- This patient has an alveolar-to-arterial O2 tension difference of 35mmHg
- Alveolar O2 tension (PAo2) must be determined using the alveolar gas equation
- Given an arterial CO2 tension of 30mmHg, the alveolar O2 tension is determined as:
	- PaO2 = (760 – 47) × 0.21 – 30 = 150 – 30 = 120 mmHg
	- Alveolar-to-arterial O2 tension difference is 120 – 85, or *35 mmHg*
- Low arterial CO2 tension and high pH indicate *respiratory alkalosis*
	- Patient has been hyperventilating and does not have metabolic alkalosis
- Respiratory alkalosis causes &darr; plasma bicarbonate levels due to slope of blood buffer line
- **NOTE** COPD leads to hypoxia and CO2 retention, not *hyPERventilation*

### Q2.7
Which one of the following acid-base changes is characteristic of hyPERventilation?

	A. Plasma pH = 7.27, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 37, urine pH = acid
	B. Plasma pH = 7.31, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 16, urine pH = acid
	C. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 15, urine pH = alkaline
	D. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 24, urine pH = acid
	E. Plasma pH = 7.55, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 22, urine pH = alkaline
	
#### Answer: E. Plasma pH = 7.55, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 22, urine pH = alkaline - *FALSE* = C. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 15, *urine pH = alkaline* - TRUE
- HyPERventilation: **L** PaCO2 = **H** pH (> 7.45); normal HCO3- (21-28 mEq/L) &rarr; E
- HyPERventilation is defined as alveolar ventilation in excess of body’s needs for CO2 elimination
	- which results in decreased arterial CO2 tension – the underlying factor in *respiratory alkalosis*
- Although CO2 tension is not given it can be calculated using the mathematical relationship: 
	- [HCO3–]/S.Paco2 = 20/1
- Applying this equation, it is clear that the value in set C indicate a decrease in CO2 tension:
- 15/S.PaCO2 = 20/1, or S.PaCO2 = 0.75mmol/L
	- Because: S.PaCO2 = 0.75mmol/L
	- And: S = 0.03mmol/L/mmHg,
	- Then: PaCO2 = 0.75/0.03 = 25mmHg
- A CO2 tension of 25mmHg is significantly lower than normal (40mmHg)
- In acute *respiratory alkalosis*, there is a 
	- &darr; in urinary H+ excretion and
	- &uarr; in urinary HCO3– excretion &rarr; **urine pH = alkaline**
- In this case, there has been *complete renal compensation*
	- As evidenced by return of [HCO3–]/S.Paco2 ratio to normal (20:1)

### Q2.8
Which one of the following acid-base changes is characteristic of _chronic respiratory tract obstruction_ by a tracheal tumour?

	A. Plasma pH = 7.27, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 37, urine pH = acid
	B. Plasma pH = 7.31, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 16, urine pH = acid
	C. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 15, urine pH = alkaline
	D. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 24, urine pH = acid
	E. Plasma pH = 7.55, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 22, urine pH = alkaline
	
#### Answer: A. Plasma pH = 7.27, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 37, urine pH = acid - TRUE
- COPD: **H** CO2 = **L** pH (< 7.35); chronic = compensation = high HCO3- (>28 mEq/L) → A
- In chronic respiratory tract obstruction (eg, due to tracheal stenosis or tumour), alveolar ventilation is insufficient to excrete CO2 at a rate required by the body, which leads to increased arterial CO2 tension – the underlying factor in respiratory acidosis. The kidney increases H+ secretion, resulting in the addition of HCO3– to the extracellular fluid. The values in set A correspond with these changes. In this case, there is partial compensation of the respiratory acidosis as evidenced by the increase in [HCO3–]. In chronic respiratory acidosis, the respiratory centre become less sensitive to hypercapnia and acidosis and relies on the associated hypoxemia as the primary drive to ventilation. Correction of the low O2 tension by the administration of O2 will diminish respiratory drive, resulting in hypoventilation, a further increase in CO2 tension, and possibly CO2 narcosis. For this reason, O2 must be given with extreme caution to patients with chronic hypercapnia.

### Q2.9
Which one of the following is most likely to _increase the glomerular filtration rate_ (GFR)?

	A. Decreased net filtration pressure
	B. Increased arterial plasma oncotic pressure
	C. Increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure
	D. Increased hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s capsule - F
	E. Vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole - F
	
#### Answer: C. Increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure - TRUE
- The major determinant of the GFR is the hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus. An increase in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure is a major force that drives fluid out of the glomerular capillary and into Bowman’s capsule. In glomerular capillaries, the net movement of fluid is primarily out of the capillaries, whereas in systemic capillaries, the change in balance of Starling forces is such that net movement out of the capillaries is nearly balanced by net return of fluid into the vessels. Increases in the plasma oncotic pressure, hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s space, and afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction decrease the GFR, as does a decrease in the net filtration pressure.

### Q2.10
Which one of the following is most likely to be seen in a 48-year-old woman who presented to the Emergency Department with _severe vomiting secondary to pyloric obstruction_?

	A. Acid urine - F
	B. A decrease in arterial CO2 tension - F
	C. An increase in alveolar ventilation - F
	D. An increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration
	E. HyPERchloraemia - F
	
#### Answer: D. An increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration - TRUE
- The severe loss of gastric fluid in this patient would produce metabolic alkalosis due to loss of HCl (a non-carbonic acid). She also would have hypovolaemia due to the fluid loss. The development of alkalosis is sensed by the chemoreceptors controlling ventilation, resulting in hypoventilation, and an increase in the arterial CO2 tension (hypercapnia), which reduces the pH towards normal. The kidneys would be expected to excrete the excess bicarbonate, raising the urinary pH.


Questions 2.11-2.20
-------------------

30% - F: 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

### Q2.11
An athlete has a *cardiac index* (Q) 6.5 L/min/m^2, *haemoglobin concentration* 12g/dL, venous O2 tension 30 mmHg, and *venous O2 saturation* 50%. Assuming 100% haemoglobin saturation in arterial blood, what is this patient’s O2 consumption?

	A. 150 mL/min/m2
	B. 275 mL/min/m2
	C. 520 mL/min/m2
	D. 790 mL/min/m2
	E. 1,030 mL/min/m2
	
#### Answer: C. 520 mL/min/m2 (*Guess*) - TRUE 
- Fick: VO2 = Q x (Ca02 - Cv02) = 6.5 x (12x1.34 x 10 x 50%) = 522.6
	- O2 consumption = 520ml/min/m^2

**Notes**
- O2 consumption can be determined using the Fick principle
	- an important concept that has wide applicability in physiology and medicine
- To calculate O2 consumption (VO2), the Fick principle is expressed as:
	- VO2 = Q x (CaO2 - CvO2), where
	- Q = blood flow and CaO2 – CvO2 = arteriovenous O2 difference
	- Cardiac Index equals Blood Flow
- Because arterial haemoglobin saturation is assumed to be 100%
	- Arterial O2 content (CaO2) equals O2 capacity 
	- Equals haemoglobin: 1.34, or 16ml/dL (160ml/L)
- Substituting these values in above equation gives:
	- VO2 = 6.5 x (160 – 80) = 520 mL/min
- It is important to use similar units for blood flow and O2 content
- In addition, converting O2 content to mL/L before calculating is recommended

### Q2.12
A _decrease in the total osmotic pressure_ of arterial blood would lead to an _increase in urine volume_ by:

	A. Directly inhibiting the reabsorption of water by the collecting ducts
	B. Increasing the hydrostatic pressure inside the glomerulus
	C. Increasing the permeability of the glomerular capillaries to water
	D. Inhibiting vasopressin secretion
	E. Stimulating the secretion of aldosterone
	
#### Answer: E. Stimulating the secretion of aldosterone - *FALSE* = D. Inhibiting vasopressin secretion - TRUE
- &darr; plasma osmolality (*osmolarity*) leads to &darr; in ADH secretion
	- Resulting in &uarr; in free-water clearance and diuresis
- These osmoreceptors are found in vicinity of supraoptic nucleus of hypothalamus
- ADH augments water permeability of cortical collecting duct 
	- And water & urea permeability of medullary collecting duct
- This &uarr; renal water reabsorption, resulting in excretion of a small volume of hypertonic urine
- Major stimuli for ADH are
	- &uarr; in plasma osmolality and 
	- &darr; in effective circulating blood volume
- Aldosterone promotes Na+ reabsorption leading to water retention

### Q2.13
Body fluid analysis of a 36-year-old male patient with _phaeochromocytoma_ is most likely to reveal a _low plasma concentration_ of:

	A. Free fatty acids
	B. Fasting glucose
	C. Insulin
	D. Lactate
	E. Pyruvate

#### Answer: C. Insulin - TRUE
- Phaeochromocytoma is an adrenal medullary tumour characterised by the hypersecretion of catecholamines, usually noradrenaline (norepinephrine). Catecholamines block insulin release (hypoinsulinaemia) and increase both gluconeogenesis and fatty acid mobilization, which account for glucose intolerance, fasting hyperglycaemia, and glycosuria. The break down of muscle glycogen leads to elevated plasma pyruvate or lactate levels. The metabolic features of phaeochromocytoma resemble hyperthyroidism and include tremor, weight loss, heat intolerance, and increased basal metabolic rate. The cardinal sign is hypertension, which may be persistent or paroxysmal. Patients usually complain of attacks that may be precipitated by emotion or physical exercise, and consist of pounding headaches, sweating, pallor, pain or tightness in the chest, apprehension, paraesthesia, nausea, and vomiting.

### Q2.14
A semicomatose 17-yo girl is brought to ED with _dry skin_, _hyperventilation_ and a _rapid pulse_. The following blood results were obtained:

Name	| Value    			| Range			|
--------|------------------:|--------------:|
pH   	| 7.14      		| 7.35-7.45
pCO2 	| 30 mmHg (4 kPa)  	| NORMAL
Na   	| 140 mEq/L 		| NORMAL
K    	| 4.5 mEq/L 		| NORMAL
Cl   	| 82 mEq/L  		| LOW
HCO3 	| 11 mEq/L  		| 21.0-28.0
Glu  	| 180 mg/dL			| HIGH

What is the _most likely diagnosis_ based on the above clinical presentation and laboratory data?

	A. Hypoglycaemia
	B. Metabolic acidosis
	C. Metabolic alkalosis
	D. Respiratory acidosis
	E. Respiratory alkalosis
	
#### Answer: B. Metabolic acidosis - TRUE (hyPERglycaemia, due to DKA)
- The decrease in arterial pH, HCO3–, and CO2 tension is consistent with metabolic acidosis. There is also a decreased HCO3–/S. PCO2 ratio and widened anion gap. The primary disturbance is the marked reduction in HCO3– and the compensatory response in hyperventilation (as indicated by the hypocapnia). The hyperglycaemia and dehydration (as evidenced by dry skin) support a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.

### Q2.15
A 56-year-old patient is taking _spironolactone_ (an aldosterone antagonist). What will be the effects of this drug on Na+ and K+ excretion?

	A. Na+ = decreased; K+ = decreased
	B. Na+ = decreased; K+ = increased
	C. Na+ = increased; K+ = decreased
	D. Na+ = increased; K+ = increased
	E. Na+ = increased; K+ = unchanged

#### Answer: B. Na+ = decreased; K+ = increased (*Guess*) - *FALSE* = C. Na+ = &uarr; K+ = &darr; - TRUE
- Spironolactone is a *competitive aldosterone antagonist* that interferes with 
	- Aldosterone-stimulated Na+ reabsorption in distal tubules and collecting duct
- Inhibition of Na+ reabsorption is
	- Associated with a marked &darr; in urinary excretion of K+ and H+
- Spironolactone is an effective diuretic in
	- Individuals with normal renal function  
	- Patients on a low Na+ diet 
	- **but** not in patients who have undergone adrenalectomy

### Q2.16
Which one of the following secretions is most dependent on _vagal stimulation_?

	A. Bile
	B. Hydrochloric acid
	C. Pancreatic juice
	D. Pepsin
	E. Saliva

#### Answer: B. Hydrochloric acid - *FALSE* = E. Saliva - TRUE
- Salivary flow is *entirely* dependent on autonomic nervous system (ANS)
	- Vagal stimulation produces a large volume of watery fluid
	- Sympathetic stimulation causes secretion of proteins (mucus and some enzymes)
- Secretion of hydrochloric acid, bile, pepsin, and pancreatic juice is 
	- Influenced by vagal stimulation **but** can occur without it

### Q2.17
A patient with loss of fluid from the gastrointestinal tract has _acidosis_ and _hyPOkalaemia_. The fluid is most likely drained from the:

	A. Colon
	B. Gallbladder
	C. Intestine
	D. Pancreas
	E. Stomach	
	
#### Answer: E. Stomach - *FALSE* = A. Colon - TRUE
- Loss of fluid from both intestine and colon causes acidosis - **only colon secretes K**
- Thus, excessive fluid loss from colon will result in both _acidosis_ and _hyPOkalaemia_

### Q2.18
The duty FY doctor request an ABG analysis after examining a 23-yo woman in the ED. The following results are obtained:

Name	| Value    			| Range				|
--------|------------------:|------------------:|
pH   	| 7.6       		| 7.35-7.45
pCO2 	| 20 mmHg (2.7 kPa)	| **VERY LOW**
PO2  	| 98 mmHg (13.0 kPa | normal
Na   	| 140 mEq/L 		| normal
K    	| 3 mEq/L   		| LOW
Cl   	| 109 mEq/L 		| HIGH
HCO3 	| 19 mEq/L  		| **slightly LOW**

These results suggest that the most likely diagnosis is:

	A. Hypoxia - F
	B. Metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation
	C. Metabolic alkalosis - F
	D. Obstructive lung disease
	E. Respiratory alkalosis

#### Answer: C. Metabolic alkalosis - *FALSE* = E. Respiratory alkalosis - TRUE
- Most likely Dx is *respiratory alkalosis* resulting from *anxiety-induced hyPERventilation* (CO2 loss)

##### Notes
- Key determinants of cause and compensation of acid–base disorder are PaCO2 tension and HCO3
	- Greater &darr; PaCO2 than &darr; HCO3 = primary disturbance is *respiratory alkalosis*
- That both arterial HCO3– and H+ change in same direction 
	- Further supports Dx of a *respiratory* acid–base imbalance 
- **NOTE** Obstructive and restrictive lung diseases - common causes of *respiratory acidosis* (CO2 retention)

### Q2.19
A 38-year-old man undergoes *lung volume studies* using the helium dilution method. The test begins at the end of a normal expiration. The initial fraction of helium in the spirometer is 0.05, and the helium fraction after equilibration with the lungs is 0.03. The volume of gas in the spirometer is kept constant at 4L during the procedure by the addition of O2. According to a spirogram, this patient’s vital capacity is 5L and his expiratory reserve volume is 2L. What is this patient’s functional residual capacity (FRC)?

What is this patient's functional residual capacity (FRC)?

	A. 1.0L
	B. 1.7L
	C. 2.7L
	D. 3.0L
	E. 5.0L
	
#### Answer: B. 1.7L (*Guess*) - *FALSE* = C. 2.7L - TRUE
- Degree of dilution = *helium_before* / *helium_after* = 0.05 / 0.03 = 1.67
	- Spirometer + Lung = 1.67 x Spirometer = 1.67 x 4 = 6.7
- Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) = *lung_before*
	- (Spirometer + Lung) - Spirometer = 6.7 - 4 = 2.7 L 

##### Notes
- Dilution test measures Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)
	- The lung volume at beginning of test
- Because volume of gas in spirometer is kept constant
	- Degree of dilution produced by lungs after equilibration must be determined by calculating
	- Ratio of initial fraction of helium to fraction of helium following equilibration (F1/F2)
		- which equals 0.05/0.03 or 1.67
- Thus, volume of spirometer plus lung volume is 1.67 times volume of spirometer, = 1.67 × 4 = 6.7L
- Subtracting volume of spirometer leaves lung volume at start of test (i.e. FRC) = 6.7 – 4 = 2.7L

### Q2.20
A 38-year-old man undergoes lung volume studies using the helium dilution method. The test begins at the end of a normal expiration. The initial fraction of helium in the spirometer is 0.05, and the helium fraction after equilibration with the lungs is 0.03. The volume of gas in the spirometer is kept constant at 4L during the procedure. by the addition of O2. According to a spirogram, this patient’s vital capacity is 5L and his expiratory reserve volume is 2L. What is this patient's residual volume (RV)?

	A. 0.7L
	B. 1.0L
	C. 1.7L
	D. 2.7L
	E. 3.0L

#### Answer: C. 1.7L (*Guess*) - *FALSE* = A. 0.7L - TRUE
- See A19
	- Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) = (0.05/0.03) x 4 - 4 = 2.7L
- Reserve Volume (RV) = Functional Reserve Capacity (FRC) - Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV)
	- RV = 2.7 - 2.0 = 0.7 L

##### Notes
- Residual volume (RV) is determined as follows
	- RV = FRC – ERV, where FRC = functional residual capacity and ERV = expiratory reserve volume
- In order to calculate RV, FRC needs to be calculated first. 
- Dilution test measures Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)
	- The lung volume at beginning of test
- Because volume of gas in spirometer is kept constant
	- Degree of dilution produced by lungs after equilibration must be determined by calculating
	- Ratio of initial fraction of helium to fraction of helium following equilibration (F1/F2)
		- which equals 0.05/0.03 or 1.67
- Thus, volume of spirometer plus lung volume is 1.67 times volume of spirometer = 1.67 × 4 = 6.7L
- Subtracting volume of spirometer leaves lung volume at start of test (i.e. FRC) = 6.7 – 4 = 2.7L
- Substituting values for FRC and ERV in equation
	- RV = FRC – ERV; RV = 2.7 – 2.0 = 0.7L


Questions 2.21-2.30
-------------------

50% - F: 21, 23, 24, 25, 26

### Q2.21
Insulin is produced by the Beta-cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. *Insulin secretion from endocrine pancreas* is inhibited by:

	A. Glucagon
	B. a2-Adrenergic agonists
	C. B-Adrenergic agonists
	D. Cholecystokinin 
	E. Muscarinic agonists
	
#### Answer: A. Glucagon - *FALSE* = B. a2-Adrenergic agonists - TRUE
- &darr; glucose in circulation and inhibitors of glucose metabolism
	- Such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose, inhibit insulin
- Insulin is also inhibited by &darr; amounts of fatty acids and amino acids
- Actions of somatostatin, sympathetic nervous stimulation and adrenaline (epinephrine) 
	- through α-adrenergic receptors are *all inhibitory to insulin release*
- **NOTE** Glucose is principal stimulus for insulin release

##### Notes
- Within 10 minutes of eating a meal rich in carbohydrates, especially simple sugars
	- blood glucose levels rise above 80mg/dl
	- this is sufficient to stimulate release and synthesis of insulin
- Naturally occurring hexoses and trioses, monosaccharides that can be metabolised
	- are more potent stimuli of insulin secretion than those that cannot be metabolised
- Oral administration of glucose tends to augment release of insulin 
	- because glucose absorption stimulates secretion of gastrointestinal (GI) hormones 
		- that also stimulate insulin secretion
- Gastric inhibitory peptide is most important GI hormone to stimulate insulin release
	- but gastrin, secretin and cholecystokinin also play a role
- Some amino acids stimulate secretion of insulin
- Glucagon, growth hormone and adrenaline, acting through its β receptor
	- all stimulate insulin release 
	- as do PNS stimulation and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)

### Q2.22
Vasopressin is release from the posterior pituitary gland when these is a decrease in plasma:

	A. [Potassium]
	B. [Sodium]
	C. pH
	D. [Volume]
	E. [Calcium]
	
#### Answer: D. [Volume] - TRUE
- Several mechanisms regulate the release of vasopressin, the most important of which are:
	- Hypovolaemia or decreased plasma volume, as occurs during haemorrhage and dehydration, results in a decrease in atrial pressure. Specialised stretch receptors within the atrial walls and large veins (cardiopulmonary baroreceptors) entering the atria decrease their firing rate when there is a fall in atrial pressure. Afferent nerve fibres from these receptors synapse within the nucleus tractus solitarius of the medulla, which sends fibres to the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that controls ADH release by the posterior pituitary. Atrial receptor firing normally inhibits the release of ADH by the posterior pituitary. With hypovolaemia or decreased central venous pressure, the decreased firing of atrial stretch receptors leads to an increase in ADH release.
	- Hypotension, which decreases arterial baroreceptor firing and leads to enhanced sympathetic activity, increases ADH release.
	- Hypothalamic osmoreceptors sense extracellular osmolarity and stimulate ADH release when osmolarity rises, as occurs with dehydration.
	- Angiotensin II receptors located in a region of the hypothalamus regulate ADH release
		- an increase in angiotensin II stimulates ADH release.

### Q2.23
The second heart sound is produced by the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. Closure of the aortic valve occurs at the onset of:

	A. The rapid ejection phase of the cardiac cycle
	B. The isovolumetic _contraction_ phase of the cardiac cycle
	C. The protodiastole
	D. The rapid filling phase of the cardiac cycle
	E. The isovolumetric _relaxation_ phase of the cardiac cycle
	
#### Answer: D. The rapid filling phase of the cardiac cycle - *FALSE* = E. The isovolumetric _relaxation_ phase of the cardiac cycle - TRUE
- Semilunar (aortic and pulmonic valves) are closed at onset of isovolumetric relaxation phase of cardiac cycle
- As ventricles continue to relax and intraventricular pressures fall
	- a point is reached when total energy of blood within the ventricles 
	- is less than energy of blood in the outflow tracts
- Pressure reversal causes aortic and pulmonic valves to abruptly close 
	- (*aortic precedes pulmonic*) *causing second heart sound* (S2)
- Valve closure is associated with a small backflow of blood into ventricles 
	- And a characteristic notch (*incisura*) in aortic and pulmonary artery pressure tracings

### Q2.24
_Turbulence_ in a blood vessel is _more likely_ to occur if:

	A. The velocity of blood within the vessel increases
	B. The diameter of the vessel decreases
	C. The viscosity of blood within the vessel increases
	D. The density of blood decreases
	E. The length of the vessel increases
	
#### Answer: B. The diameter of the vessel decreases - *FALSE* = A. The velocity of blood within the vessel increases - TRUE
- Reynold's Number, Nr = (ρ x v x D) / µ, where
	- ρ = density
	- v = velocity
	- D = diameter
	- µ = viscosity

##### Notes
- Resistance to sliding flow between fluid layers can lead to irregular flow known as turbulence
	- Amount of turbulence in a fluid depends on velocity and general characteristics of fluid
- If layers of a fluid slide easily over each other
	- Fluid is said to exhibit laminar flow = *little turbulence*
- *Reynold's number* serves as an indicator for the type of flow that a fluid will exhibit 
	- NR, depends on density ρ, velocity v, diameter D and viscosity η
		- Nr = (rho x v x D) / η
- **NOTE** &uarr; length of vessel may indirectly &darr; likelihood of turbulence
	- By &uarr; vascular resistance and &darr; blood velocity

### Q2.25
The affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen will _increase_ if:

	A. Arterial PO2 is increased
	B. pH is decreased
	C. Blood temperature is increased
	D. H+ concentration is increased 
	E. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (PDG) levels in RBCs are *decreased*
	
#### Answer: A. Arterial PO2 is increased - *FALSE* = E. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (PDG) levels in RBCs are decreased - TRUE
- *Oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve* is capable of shifting to right or left
- &uarr; blood PCO2 or hydrogen ion concentration [H+] &darr; pH shifts curve to right
	- whereas &darr; in PCO2 or [H+] &uarr; pH shifts curve to left
- Shifts in oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve as a result of changes in blood PCO2 or pH termed *Bohr effect* 
- An &uarr; blood temperature or 2,3-DPG levels in RBCs 
	- also shifts oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve to right
	- &darr; temperature or 2,3-DPG shifts curve to left
- A shift in oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve to right means that more O2 is liberated for a given &darr; in PO2
- Stated another way
	- a shift in curve to right indicates that affinity of haemoglobin for O2 is reduced, 
	- so that, for a given plasma PO2, more O2 is freed from haemoglobin
- In contrast 
	- a shift in curve to left means that more O2 will be attached to haemoglobin (*increased affinity*) for a given PO2 
	- Thus, less O2 is available to tissues or is freed from haemoglobin at a given PO2

### Q2.26
A patient with *persistent diarrhoea* will have an _increased_:

	A. Anion gap
	B. Filtered load of bicarbonate
	C. Production of ammonia by the distal tubule
	D. H+ secretion by the distal tubule
	E. Production of new bicarbonate by the proximal tubule
	
#### Answer: B. Filtered load of bicarbonate - *FALSE* = D. H+ secretion by the distal tubule - TRUE
- Persistent diarrhoea will result in *metabolic acidosis* (&uarr; [H+]) 
	- Due to loss of *bicarbonate-rich* secretions from *pancreas and gallbladder*

##### Notes
- Response of body to &uarr; H+ concentration involves several processes
	- First and most readily available process is extracellular buffering
	- Most readily measured extracellular buffer is carbonic acid (H2CO3)
- This buffer is considered an open buffering system because compensatory mechanisms in
	1. respiratory carbon dioxide (CO2) (&uarr; or &darr; in ventilation) 
	2. and renal HCO3– (&uarr; or &darr; in kidney reclamation of HCO3–) maintain equilibrium
- Metabolic acidosis stimulates central and peripheral chemoreceptors that control respiration
	- Resulting in an &uarr; in alveolar ventilation
	- Which in turn results in *compensatory respiratory alkalosis*
- As a result of buffering of H+ by HCO3– plasma concentration of HCO3– will &darr;
	- which will &darr; amount of HCO3– that is filtered in proximal tubule
- At same time 
	- *metabolic acidosis* will &uarr; ammonia production by proximal tubule 
	- as well as H+ secretion and production of new bicarbonate by distal nephron
- As *metabolic acidosis* is produced by loss of bicarbonate
	- anion gap will remain within normal limits

### Q2.27
A patient in the ED with _profuse haemorrhage from a severed limb artery_ will have _increased_:

	A. Sodium excretion
	B. Sympathetic nerve activity
	C. Vagal nerve activity
	D. Arteriolar diameter in skin
	E. Water excretion
	
#### Answer: B. Sympathetic nerve activity - TRUE
- Haemorrhage is compensated for by several methods that are both acute and chronic fixes for the problem. Rapid compensation for low blood volume include vaso- and venoconstriction, increased heart rate (tachycardia), adrenergic output from the adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerves, secretion of vasopressin, glucocorticoids, renin, aldosterone and erythropoietin, and hepatic plasma protein synthesis. By decreasing urine formation, retaining sodium and water, increasing blood pressure, stimulation of blood cell formation and increasing plasma oncotic pressure, the net effect is to feed the brain and heart while restoring normal blood volume.

### Q2.28
Intestinal peristalsis results in the movement of food through the gut. Intestinal peristalsis:

	A. Is controlled by extrinsic innervation - F
	B. Is inhibited by vagotomy - F
	C. Is inhibited by sympathectomy - F
	D. Requires an intact myenteric nerve plexus
	E. Is inhibited by cholecystokinin - F	

#### Answer: D. Requires an intact myenteric nerve plexus - TRUE
- Peristalsis is a distinctive pattern of smooth muscle contractions that propels foodstuffs distally through the oesophagus and intestines. It was first described by Bayliss and Starling as a type of motility in which there is contraction above and relaxation below a segment that is being stimulated. Peristalsis is not affected to any degree by vagotomy or sympathectomy, indicating its mediation by the intestine’s local, intrinsic nervous system. Peristalsis is a manifestation of two major reflexes within the enteric nervous system that are stimulated by a bolus of foodstuff in the lumen. Mechanical distension and perhaps mucosal irritation stimulate afferent enteric neurons. 
- These sensory neurons synapse with two sets of cholinergic interneurons, which lead to two distinct effects:
	- One group of interneurons activates excitatory motor neurons above the bolus; these neurons, which contain acetylcholine and substance P, stimulate contraction of smooth muscle above the bolus.
	- Another group of interneurons activates inhibitory motor neurons that stimulate relaxation of smooth muscle below the bolus. These inhibitor neurons appear to use nitric oxide, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and ATP as neurotransmitters.

### Q2.29
Secretin was the first substance that was identified to cause a physiological effect in the body after being transported via the blood. Which of the following statements about secretin is true?

	A. It is a polypeptide hormone made up of 17 amino acids
	B. It increases gallbladder emptying
	C. It is released by the presence of long-chain fatty acids in the chyme
	D. It stimulates bicarbonate release from the pancreas
	E. It inhibits pepsinogen secretion

#### Answer: D. It stimulates bicarbonate release from the pancreas - TRUE
- Secretin is a peptide hormone made of 27 amino acids, produced in the crypts of lieberkühn of the duodenum and released in response to a luminal pH <4.5. It stimulates fluid and bicarbonate release from the pancreas and stimulates pepsinogen secretion.

### Q2.30
A 72-year-old woman developed an acute pulmonary embolism 3 days after her total hip replacement. Which of the following features is most likely to be seen in this patient?

	A. Increased PCO2
	B. Increased PO2
	C. Decreased alveolar dead space
	D. Decreased right ventricular afterload
	E. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance

#### Answer: E. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance - TRUE
- Acute respiratory consequences of pulmonary embolism include increased alveolar dead space, pneumoconstriction, hypoxaemia and hyperventilation, leading to low PCO2. Later, two additional consequences may occur: regional loss of surfactant and pulmonary infarction. Arterial hypoxaemia is a frequent but not universal finding in patients with acute embolism. The mechanisms of hypoxaemia include ventilation/perfusion mismatch, intrapulmonary shunts, reduced cardiac output and intracardiac shunt via a patent foramen ovale. Pulmonary infarction is an uncommon consequence because of the bronchial arterial collateral circulation. Pulmonary embolism reduces the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed, resulting in an increment in pulmonary vascular resistance, which, in turn, increases the right ventricular afterload. If the afterload is increased severely, right ventricular failure may ensue. In addition, the humoral and reflex mechanisms contribute to the pulmonary arterial constriction. Prior poor cardiopulmonary status of the patient is an important factor, leading to haemodynamic collapse.


Questions 2.31-2.40
-------------------

70% - F: 31, 35, 39

### Q2.31
What will be the *interstitial osmotic pressure* in a skin capillary if fluid is being forced out of it with a net filtration pressure of 8 mmHg when the capillary hydrostatic pressure is 24 mmHg, interstitial hydrostatic pressure 7 mmHg and capillary osmotic pressure 17 mmHg? (_Assume that both the filtration coefficient and reflection coefficient in this case are 1_).

	A. 8 mmHg
	B. 6 mmHg
	C. 9 mmHg
	D. –9 mmHg
	E. -6 mmHg

#### Answer: B. 6 mmHg - *FALSE* = A. 8 mmHg - TRUE
- Starling’s hypothesis states that fluid movement as a result of filtration 
	- across the wall of a capillary is dependent on balance between
		1. Hydrostatic pressure gradient, and 
		2. Oncotic pressure gradient across capillary
- Net driving pressure = [(Pc – Pi) – (πc – πi)] 
	- Net filtration pressure (Pnf) = 8 mmHg
	- Capillary 
		- Hydrostatic pressure (Pc) = 24 mmHg
		- Osmotic pressure (πc) = 17 mmHg
	- Interstitial 
		- Hydrostatic pressure (Pi) = 7 mmHg
		- Osmotic Pressure (πi) - UNKNOWN
- Osmotic Pressure (πi) = Pnf + πc - (Pc – Pi) = 8 + 17 - (24 - 7) = 8 mmHg

##### Notes	
- Starling's forces are:
	1. Hydrostatic pressure in capillary (Pc)
	2. Hydrostatic pressure in interstitium (Pi)
	3. Oncotic pressure in capillary (πc)
	4. Oncotic pressure in interstitium (πi)
- Balance of these forces allows calculation of net driving pressure for filtration:
	- Net driving pressure = [(Pc – Pi) – r x (πc – πi)]
- Net fluid flux is proportional to net driving pressure
	- Reflection coefficient = r
 
### Q2.32
When air enters the intrapleural space (*pneumothorax*), the most likely response is for:

	A. The lung to expand outwards and the chest wall to spring inwards
	B. The lung to expand outwards and the chest wall to spring outwards
	C. The lung to collapse inwards and the chest wall to collapse inwards
	D. The lung to collapse inwards and the chest wall to spring outwards
	E. The lung volume to be unaffected and chest wall to spring outwards
	
#### Answer: D. The lung to collapse inwards and the chest wall to spring outwards - TRUE
- Pneumothorax is the presence of air within the pleural space. Pneumothorax is considered to be one of the most common forms of thoracic disease and is classified as spontaneous (not caused by trauma), traumatic or iatrogenic. Entry of air into the pleural space results in collapse of the lung. The primary physical sign of pneumothorax is a decrease or absence of breath sounds despite normal or increased resonance on percussion. However, this may be difficult to detect, particularly in patients with a small pneumothorax or in those who have underlying emphysema. Patients with a small pneumothorax (involving <15% of the hemithorax) may have a normal physical examination. Tachycardia is the most common physical finding. Large pneumothoraces can cause decreased movement of the chest wall, a hyperresonant percussion note, diminished tactile focal fremitus and resonance, and decreased or absent breath sounds on the affected side. Haemodynamic instability, which is indicated by tachycardia, hypotension and cyanosis, suggests a tension pneumothorax. Arterial blood gases may reveal acute respiratory alkalosis and an increased alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient. Unusual clinical manifestations of pneumothorax include ptosis (as a result of extension of subcutaneous emphysema), pneumocephalus (secondary to tension pneumothorax associated with a comminuted fracture of the thoracic spine) and recurrent pneumopericardium (in association with a pleuropericardial defect).

### Q2.33
Haemodynamic changes in response to _obstruction of venous return_ to the _right side of the heart_ include:

	A. Cardiac output will fall and systemic arterial blood pressure will fall
	B. Cardiac output will rise and systemic arterial blood pressure will rise
	C. Cardiac output will fall and systemic arterial blood pressure will rise
	D. Cardiac output will fall and systemic arterial blood pressure will remain unchanged
	E. Cardiac output will remain unchanged and systemic arterial blood pressure will fall

#### Answer: C. Cardiac output will fall and systemic arterial blood pressure will rise - TRUE
- As a result of obstruction to venous return, the right atrial pressure falls, leading to a fall in left atrial pressure, which in turn results in a decreased preload on the left ventricle. This decrease in preload lowers cardiac output. The fall in cardiac output is compensated for by an increase in total peripheral resistance, a rise in systemic arterial blood pressure, a fall in the urine production and a rise in the heart rate.

### Q2.34
Common features of a _tumour of the right atrium_ and _cardiac tamponade_ include:

	A. Pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary venous congestion
	B. Pulmonary venous congestion, systemic venous congestion and systemic hypotension
	C. Systemic oedema, high cardiac output and ascites
	D. Systemic oedema, congestion of the systemic veins and ascites
	E. Pulmonary oedema, systemic hypertension and low cardiac output

#### Answer: D. Systemic oedema, congestion of the systemic veins and ascites - TRUE
- Each of these stresses involves obstruction of blood flow into the right atrium. The excess blood in the circulation is pooled in the venous system resulting in engorged veins. Urine production falls, exacerbating the patient’s illness. The increase in intravascular pressure causes fluid to be filtered out of the circulation and into the extravascular space, leading to systemic oedema and ascites.

### Q2.35
Voltage-gated sodium channels are an example of a protein embedded in the plasma membrane of nerve and muscle cells that is used in the rapid electrical signalling found in these cells. _Voltage-gated sodium channels_:
	
	A. Are formed by co-assembly of five identical or similar subunits
	B. Have specialised transmembrane domains (S4) that sense transmembrane voltage
	C. Are equally permeable to K+ and Na+
	D. Are activated by binding of glycine
	E. Are activated by a decrease in intracellular ATP concentration
	
#### Answer: E. Are activated by a decrease in intracellular ATP concentration - *FALSE* = B. Have specialised transmembrane domains (S4) that sense transmembrane voltage - TRUE
- Voltage-gated sodium channels are crucial for the propagation of action potentials in excitable membranes
	- Causing cell membrane to depolarise by allowing influx of Na+ into cell
- Some 7000 sodium ions pass through each channel during the brief period (about 1 ms) that it remains open
- Voltage-gated Na+ channels consist of an subunit responsible for selectivity and voltage gating
- However, some sodium channels also have one or two smaller subunits called β-1 and β-2
- The protein has four homologous domains containing multiple potential α-helical transmembrane segments
	- Segments are connected by non-conserved, hydrophilic, intervening segments
- **NOTE** Fourth transmembrane segment (S4) is highly positively charged (*voltage sensor*)

### Q2.36
Cells with in the sinoatrial (SA) node are the primary pacemaker site within the heart. These cells are characterised as having no true resting potential, but instead generate regular, spontaneous action potentials. Phase O of an SA nodal action potential results from:

	A. Activation of sodium channels
	B. Activation of the pacemaker current
	C. Influx of Ca2+ ions
	D. Inactivation of K+ channels
	E. Influx of Na+ ions
	
#### Answer: C. Influx of Ca2+ ions - TRUE
- Cells within the sinoatrial (SA) node are the primary pacemaker site within the heart. These cells are characterised as having no true resting potential, but instead generate regular, spontaneous action potentials. Unlike most other cells that elicit action potentials (eg nerve cells, muscle cells), the depolarising current is carried primarily by relatively slow, inward Ca2+ currents instead of by fast Na+ currents. There are, in fact, no fast Na+ currents operating in SA nodal cells.
- Phase 0 depolarisation is primarily a result of increased Ca2+ conductance. As a result of the movement (or conductance) of Ca2+ through their channels not being rapid (hence, the term ‘slow inward Ca2+ channels’), the rate of depolarisation (slope of phase 0) is much slower than found in other cardiac cells (eg Purkinje cells).

### Q2.37
What should the myeloid:erythroid ratio in your bone marrow be if you want to be a _voluntary bone marrow donor_?

	A. 1:1
	B. 1:3
	C. 3:1
	D. 1:10
	E. 10.1
	
#### Answer: C. 3:1 - TRUE
- The normal bone marrow examination findings include:
	- Fat:cell ratio
	- Child aged <10 years: 10% fat:90% cells
	- Adult: 30–70% fat:70–30% cells
	- **Myeloid:erythroid ratio: 3:1**
	- Erythroid cells: 18–39% of marrow nucleated cells
	- Megakaryocytes: 0.5–2% of nucleated cells in marrow
	- Lymphocytes: 11–23% of nucleated cells in marrow
	- T lymphocytes: B lymphocytes = 3:1
	- Plasma cells: 0.4–3.9% of nucleated cells in marrow
	- Myeloid cells: 60–75% of nucleated cells in marrow
	- Neutrophilic series: 49–65%
	- Eosinophilic series: 1.2–5.3%
	- Basophilic series and mast cells: <0.2%.

### Q2.38
Substances with high oil:water partition coefficients readily permeate cell membranes. Which group has high oil:water partition coefficients?

	A. Peptides, steroid hormones, oxygen
	B. Steroid hormones, oxygen, ions
	C. Oxygen, ions, carbon dioxide
	D. Ions, carbon dioxide, steroid hormones
	E. Carbon dioxide, steroid hormones, oxygen
		
#### Answer: E. Carbon dioxide, steroid hormones, oxygen - TRUE
- The oil/water partition coefficient (β) is obtained by:
	- [Solute]oil/[Solute]water after dissolving it in a 50:50 oil:water mix
- Lipid-soluble compounds (hydrophobic) have high partition coefficients; water-soluble compounds have low partition coefficients.
- Molecules with a large β value have a greater effective transmembrane solute gradient for a given concentration difference between the extracellular fluid and cytoplasm
Molecules with a small β value have a lower effective transmembrane solute gradient
- Carbon dioxide, steroid hormones and oxygen have high coefficients and readily permeate cell membranes

### Q2.39
_Stroke volume_ is the amount of *blood pumped by the left ventricle* of the heart in one contraction. Which of the following statements about stroke volume is true?

	A. It is the difference between the ventricular end-systolic volume and ventricular end-diastolic volume
	B. It is normally 120ml in an adult weighing 70kg
	C. It is decreased by sympathetic activation of the heart
	D. It is increased by increased venous return
	E. It is increased by systemic hypertension

#### Answer: A. It is the difference between the ventricular end-systolic volume and ventricular end-diastolic volume - *FALSE* = D. It is increased by increased venous return - TRUE
- Ventricular stroke volume (SV) is difference between ventricular
	- End-diastolic volume (EDV) = 120 mL
	- End-systolic volume (ESV) = 50 mL 
- Difference in these volumes, 70ml, represents SV = EDV - ESV
	- Any factor that alters either EDV or ESV will change SV

##### Notes - HERE
- There are three primary mechanisms that regulate EDV and ESV, and therefore SV
- SV is regulated is by the Frank–Starling mechanism
- &uarr; in preload (&uarr; venous return) = &uarr; ventricular EDV
	- &uarr; force of ventricular contraction
	- Enables heart to eject additional blood that was returned to it
- Conversely, &darr; in venous return leads to &darr; in SV by this mechanism

###### Afterload
- Afterload affects ability of ventricle to eject blood
	- &uarr; in afterload (e.g. increased aortic pressure) &darr; SV by &uarr; ESV
	- &darr; in afterload augments SV

###### Inotropy (*Contractility*)
- Inotropy (*contractility*) alters rate of ventricular pressure development
	- &uarr; inotropy (e.g. sympathetic activation of heart) decreases ESV and increases SV
	- &darr; inotropy (e.g. heart failure) reduces SV by increasing ESV

### Q2.40
Which of the following statements about electrolyte concentration of body fluids is correct?

	A. Plasma has 20 mmol/L Mg2
	B. Interstitial fluid has 10 mmol/L Cl
	C. Intracellular fluid has 30 mmol/L HCO3
	D. Plasma has 2.5 mmol/L SO4 
	E. Intracellular fluid has 150 mmol/L K+

#### Answer: E. Intracellular fluid has 150 mmol/L K+ - TRUE
- Electrolyte concentration of body fluids

##### Cations (mmol/L)

Electrolyte	| Plasma	| Interstitial	| Intracellular	|
------------|----------:|--------------:|--------------:|
Na			| 142		| 144			|  10
K			|   4		|   4			| **150**

PO4			|   1		|   1			| 45


Questions 2.41-2.50
-------------------

50% - F: 41, 42, 47, 49, 50

### Q2.41
A patient in ED is noted to have _metabolic acidosis_ with a _normal anion gap_. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be associated with this abnormality?

	A. Renal failure
	B. Rhabdomyolysis
	C. Lactic acidosis
	D. Alcoholic ketoacidosis
	E. Ureterosigmoidostomy

#### Answer: B. Rhabdomyolysis - *FALSE* = E. Ureterosigmoidostomy - TRUE
- Metabolic acidosis results from 
	1. Accumulation of non-volatile acids
	2. Reduction of renal acid excretion 
	3. Loss of alkali
- Anion gap (normal 3–11 mmol/L) represents anions (other than Cl and HCO3) necessary to counterbalance Na:
	- Anion Gap (AG) = (Na + K) – (Cl + HCO3), where K is usually dropped in daily practice

##### Metabolic Acidosis
###### Normal Anion-Gap 
- Normal anion gap (*hyPERchloraemic*) *metabolic acidosis* results from 
	- Loss of bicarbonate-rich fluids from GIT (eg diarrhoea or pancreatic or biliary fistula), or 
	- Kidney (eg renal tubular acidosis, K+– sparing diuretics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors)
- Can occur after *administration of HCl* - *parenteral nutrition* and **ureterosigmoidostomy**

###### Increased Anion-Gap 
- Increased AG metabolic acidosis occurs in the setting of 
	- Toxic ingestions (e.g. salicylates, methanol, ethylene glycol)
	- Rhabdomyolysis
	- Overproduction of endogenous acids (e.g. lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis) 
	- Consequence of renal failure
- **NOTE** Lactic acidosis (normal serum lactate 0.3-1.3 mmol/L) is one of 
	- Most common causes of severe metabolic acidosis in critically ill surgical patients

### Q2.42
A patient on the surgical ward is noted to have _metabolic alkalosis_ with a urine [Cl] of <15 mmol/L. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be associated with this abnormality?
 
	A. Nasogastric suctioning
	B. Mineralocorticoid excess
	C. Alkali loading
	D. Concurrent diuretic administration
	E. Severe hyPOkalaemia

#### Answer: C. Alkali loading - *FALSE* = A. Nasogastric suctioning - TRUE
- Cause of *metabolic alkalosis* is usually apparent in surgical patient
	- Urinary Cl– concentration is useful in differentiating disorders

##### Urine Cl Concentration

###### Low Cl
- Urine [Cl] < 15 mmol/L suggests
	- Vomiting
	- **Nasogastric suctioning**
	- Post-diuretic administration
	- Post-hypercapnia

###### High Cl
- Urine [Cl] > 20 mmol/L suggests 
	- Mineralocorticoid excess
	- Alkali loading
	- Concurrent diuretic administration
	- Presence of severe hyPOkalaemia

### Q2.43
The ejection fraction is a measurement of the heart's efficiency and can be used to estimate the function of the left ventricle, which pumps blood to the rest of the body. In a resting healthy individual the ejection fraction is:

	A. 20%
	B. 30%
	C. 45%
	D. >60%
	E. 90%
	
#### Answer: D. >60% - TRUE
- Ejection fraction (EF) is fraction of blood ejected by ventricle relative to its end-diastolic volume
	- Therefore, EF is calculated from: EF = (SV/EDV) × 100
	- where SV is the stroke volume and EDV is the end-diastolic volume
- EF is most commonly measured using echocardiography
	- This noninvasive technique provides good estimates of EDV, ESV and SV (SV = EDV – ESV)
- Normally, EF is >60%. For example, if the SV is 75ml and the EDV 120ml, then the EF is 63%. During exercise in highly conditioned individuals, the increased SV (caused primarily by increased inotropy) can result in the EF exceeding 90%. In heart failure, particularly in dilated cardiomyopathy, the EF can become very small as the SV decreases and EDV increases. In severe heart failure, the EF may be only 20%. The EF is often used as a clinical index to evaluate the inotropic status of the heart. However, it is important to note that there are circumstances in which the EF can be normal, yet the ventricle is in failure. One example is diastolic dysfunction caused by hypertrophy, in which filling is impaired because of low ventricular compliance and SV is therefore reduced.

### Q2.44
A 42-yo woman with small cell carcinoma of her left lung was noticed to have the following biochemical abnormalities:

Name              | Value         | Status				|
------------------|--------------:|------
Serum Na          | 125 mmol/L    | LOW = HyPOnatraemia
Plasma Osmolality | 250 mosmol/kg | LOW = HyPOtonicity           
Urine Osmolality  | 150 mosmol/kg | HIGH = Concentrated Urine           
Urine Na          |  30 mmol/L    | HIGH = Elevated Urine Na

Excess of which of the following hormones is responsible for this abnormal biochemical profile?

	A. Thyroxine
	B. Oxycontin
	C. Cortisol
	D. Adrenaline (epinephrine)
	E. Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH)

#### Answer: E. Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) - TRUE
- This patient has got excess ADH (vasopressin) release, resulting in the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH). Ordinarily, release of ADH from the posterior pituitary gland occurs as a physiological response to a drop in plasma volume or an increase in serum osmolality. Non-osmotically driven secretion of ADH in the absence of a haemodynamic disturbance characterises SIADH. 
- Specific diagnostic criteria that define SIADH include the following:
	- HyPOnatraemia (serum Na+ <135mmol/L)
	- HyPOtonicity (plasma osmolality <280 mosmol/kg)
	- Inappropriately concentrated urine (>100 mosmol/kg water)
	- Elevated urine Na+ concentration (>20mmol/L), except during Na+ restriction
	- Clinical euvolaemia
	- Normal renal, adrenal and thyroid function
- Sodium serves as the major determinant of serum osmolality and reflects the relative ratio of Na+:H2O in the blood. ADH, a water-retaining hormone, promotes water retention by increasing the permeability of nephrons. Elevation in the ADH level despite low serum Na+ levels and decreased osmolality indicates the presence of a non-osmotic stimulus for ADH release. Excess ADH may emerge from the pituitary gland or an ectopic source, such as neoplasms and/or pulmonary tissue.
- Neoplastic cells obtained from tumours of patients with SIADH are characterised by the potential to synthesise, store and secrete ADH (eg increased levels of ADH found in about 60% of patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung). Even though hyponatraemia accompanying SIADH arises from an increase in total body water, this condition is sometimes referred to, confusingly, as a cause of euvolaemic hyponatraemia. Patients with SIADH demonstrate relatively normal Na+ excretion (if intake is normal), high urine osmolality and only subtle evidence of volume expansion.
- As most excess body water accumulates intracellularly and not in the intravascular space, evidence of oedema, ascites and heart failure is absent. However, intracellular oedema alters cell functions, with the central nervous system being the most sensitive to these changes.

### Q2.45
A 65-yo woman was admitted with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Her ABG on room air showed:

Name  |      Value	| Range		|
------|------------:|----------:|
pH    | 7.29		| ?
PaCO2 | 8.5kPa		| ?
PaO2  | 8.0kPa		| ?
HCO3  | 30.5 mmol/L	| ?

What is the acid-base disturbance?

	A. Metabolic acidosis
	B. Respiratory acidosis
	C. Metabolic alkalosis
	D. Respiratory alkalosis
	E. Compensated metabolic acidosis

#### Answer: B. Respiratory acidosis - TRUE
- This patient had respiratory acidosis as the Paco2 is high and standard bicarbonate is slightly elevated. This is a common finding in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Respiratory acidosis is a clinical disturbance that is due to alveolar hypoventilation. Production of carbon dioxide occurs rapidly, and failure of ventilation promptly increases the partial arterial pressure of carbon dioxide (Paco2). The reference range for Paco2 is 36–44mmHg (4.4–5.9kPa). Alveolar hypoventilation leads to an increased Paco2 (ie, hypercapnia). The increase in Paco2 in turn decreases the HCO3–/Paco2 and decreases pH. Hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis occur when impairment in ventilation occurs and the removal of CO2 by the lungs is less than the production of CO2 in the tissues. In acute respiratory acidosis, compensation occurs in two steps. The initial response is cellular buffering that occurs over minutes to hours. Cellular buffering elevates plasma bicarbonate (HCO3–) only slightly, approximately 1 mEq/L (1mmol/L) for each 10mmHg (1.33kPa) increase in Paco2. The second step is renal compensation that occurs over 3–5 days. With renal compensation, renal excretion of carbonic acid is increased and bicarbonate reabsorption is increased. In renal compensation, plasma bicarbonate rises 3.5 mEq/L (3.5mmol/L) for each increase of 10mmHg (1.33kPa) in Paco2. 

- The expected change in serum bicarbonate concentration in respiratory acidosis can be estimated as follows:
	- Acute respiratory acidosis: HCO3– increases 1 mEq/L (1mmol/L) for each 10mmHg (1.33kPa) rise in PaCO2
	- Chronic respiratory acidosis: HCO3– rises 3.5 mEq/L (3.5mmol/L) for each 10mmHg (1.33kPa) rise in PaCO2
- The expected change in pH with respiratory acidosis can be estimated with the following equations:
	- Acute respiratory acidosis: Change in pH: 0.008 × (40 – Paco2)
	- Chronic respiratory acidosis: change in pH: 0.003 × (40 – Paco2)
 
- Respiratory acidosis does not have a great effect on electrolyte levels. Some small effects occur on calcium and potassium levels. Acidosis decreases binding of calcium to albumin and tends to increase serum ionized calcium levels. In addition, acidaemia causes an extracellular shift of potassium, but respiratory acidosis rarely causes clinically significant hyperkalaemia.

### Q2.46
The following values were obtained from a Swan-Ganz catheter in a patient who was admitted to an ICU with low cardiac output (CO) after myocardial infarction (MI)

Measurement                            | Value		|
---------------------------------------|-----------:|
Cardiac output (CO)                    | 2.0L/min
Mean arterial pressure MAP             | 50 mmHg
Central venous pressure (CVP)          | 14 mmHg
Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) | 16 mmHg
Mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP)  | 35 mmHg

	A.  800 dyn/cm^2
	B. 1000 dyn/cm^2
	C. 1440 dyn/cm^2
	D. 1500 dyn/cm^2
	E. 1620 dyn/cm^2

#### Answer: C. 1440 dyn/cm^2 (*Guess*) - TRUE
- The flow-directed balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter (also known as the Swan–Ganz catheter) has been in clinical use for almost 30 years. Initially developed for the management of acute myocardial infarction, it now has widespread use in the management of a variety of critical illnesses and surgical procedures. It is used for estimation of pressure in the right atrium (central venous pressure or CVP), right ventricle and pulmonary artery, and of pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP). Other important information provided by a Swan–Ganz catheter includes the cardiac output (CO), mixed venous oxygen saturation Svo2 and oxygen saturations in the right heart chambers to assess for the presence of an intracardiac shunt. Using these measurements, other variables can be derived, including pulmonary or systemic vascular resistance and the difference between arterial and venous oxygen content.
- Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) can be calculated by using the following formula:
	- SVR = (MAP – CVP/CO) × 80, where MAP is mean arterial pressure
- Thus, substituting the values in this equation, the SVR for this patient is 1440 dyn/cm2

### Q2.47
A Swan-Hanz catheter inserted into a patient with low cardiac output records a *pulmonary artery wedge pressure* (PAWP) of 18 mmHg. The same pressure would be expected in which of the following structures.

	A. Systemic veins
	B. Right ventricle
	C. Left ventricle
	D. Aorta
	E. Left atrium

#### Answer: B. Right ventricle - *FALSE* = E. Left atrium - TRUE
- The measurement of the PAWP, also known as the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), provides an indirect measure of left atrial pressure and is particularly useful in the diagnosis of left ventricular failure and mitral stenosis. The measurement is made as follows. A balloon-tipped, multi-lumen (Swan–Ganz) catheter is advanced from a peripheral vein into the right atrium and right ventricle and then positioned within a branch of the pulmonary artery. There is one opening (port) at the tip of the catheter (distal to the balloon) and a second port several centimetres proximal to the balloon. These ports are connected to pressure transducers. When properly positioned in a branch of the pulmonary artery, the distal port measures pulmonary artery pressure (about 30/15mmHg) and the proximal port measures right atrial pressure (about 0–2mmHg). The balloon is then inflated with air using a syringe (the balloon volume is about 1ml) which occludes the branch of the pulmonary artery. When this occurs, the pressure in the distal port rapidly falls and, after about 10 seconds, reaches a stable lower value that is very similar to left atrial pressure (normally about 8–10mmHg). The balloon is then deflated. The recorded pressure during balloon inflation is similar to the left atrial pressure because the occluded vessel, along with its distal branches that eventually form the pulmonary veins, acts as a long catheter that measures the blood pressures within the pulmonary veins (this pressure is virtually the same as mean left atrial pressure). A PAWP exceeding 15mmHg suggests mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, severe aortic stenosis or left ventricular failure. When the PAWP exceeds 20mmHg, the transmission of this pressure back into the pulmonary vasculature increases pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure, which can lead to pulmonary congestion and oedema.

### Q2.48
A 40-yo man is on injectable vitamin B12 replacement therapy after a gastrectomy for a tumour involving the gastric fundus. Absence of which of the following cell types is responsible for this vitamin replacement requirement

	A. Parietal cells
	B. Chief cells
	C. G-cells
	D. Mucus neck cells
	E. Goblet cells

#### Answer: A. Parietal cells - TRUE
- The parietal cells of the stomach produce intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein that forms a complex with dietary vitamin B12. The stimulus for production can be either vagal, gastrin or histamine signals. The ileum has specific receptors on its enterocytes for the complex. In the presence of calcium ions and a low pH, vitamin B12 is then taken up by the cell and intrinsic factor is re-released into the gut. Patients without a stomach and those with pernicious anaemia require injectable vitamin B12 replacement therapy. Parietal cells also synthesise and secrete hydrochloric acid. Chief cells secrete pepsinogen, the proenzyme form of pepsin. G-cells secrete gastrin, which stimulates secretion of acid by parietal cells found in the body and fundus of the stomach. Goblet cells are part of the mucosa of the small intestine, not the stomach. Mucus neck cells secrete mucus and are located in the necks of the gastric glands.

### Q2.49
Release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland occurs as a physiological response to a _drop in plasma volume_ or an _increase in serum osmolality_. In the _presence of ADH_ the glomerular filtrate will be isotonic to plasma in:

	A. The ascending limb of the loop of Henle
	B. The cortical collecting tubule
	C. The medullary collecting tubule
	D. The descending limb of the loop of Henle
	E. The renal pelvis	
#### Answer: D. The descending limb of the loop of Henle - *FALSE* = B. The cortical collecting tubule - TRUE
- ADH increases water permeability of *cortical and medullary collecting tubules*
	- Allowing filtrate to reach osmotic equilibrium with interstitial fluid surrounding nephron

##### Notes
- Interstitial fluid in cortex of kidney is isotonic to plasma
	- Therefore filtrate can become isotonic to plasma in cortical collecting tubule
- Interstitial fluid is hypertonic to plasma in medullary collecting tubule
	- So filtrate becomes hypertonic to plasma in this region of nephron 
	- And remains hypertonic as it passes through renal pelvis
- ADH has **no effect** on water permeability of Loop of Henle
- Filtrate is hypertonic to plasma in descending limb
	- Becoming hypotonic to plasma by time it reaches ascending limb of Loop of Henle

### Q2.50
A 23-yo man arrived in the ED in shock with *profuse bleeding from his femoral vessels* after a gun shot injury to his right groin. Which of the following changes is most likely to be anticipated in this patient?

	A. Decreased release of thromboxane A2 at the site of injury
	B. Increased baseline vagal tone
	C. Dilatation of veins and venous reservoirs
	D. Increased renin secretion from the juxtaglomerular apparatus
	E. Decreased level of circulating ADH

#### Answer: B. Increased baseline vagal tone - *FALSE* = D. Increased renin secretion from the juxtaglomerular apparatus - TRUE
- Patient is in haemorrhagic shock as a result of acute blood loss
- Body responds to acute haemorrhage by activating 4 major systems:
	1. Haematological
	2. Cardiovascular
	3. Renal
	4. Neuroendocrine

##### Haematological System
- Haematological system responds to an acute severe blood loss by activating the coagulation cascade and contracting the bleeding vessels (by means of local thromboxane A2 release)
- In addition, platelets are activated (also by means of local thromboxane A2 release) and form an immature clot on the bleeding source
- The damaged vessel exposes collagen, which subsequently causes fibrin deposition and stabilisation of the clot
- About 24 h are needed for complete clot fibrination and mature formation.

##### Cardiovascular System
- Cardiovascular system initially responds to hypovolaemic shock by increasing the heart rate, increasing myocardial contractility and constricting peripheral blood vessels
- This response occurs secondary to an increased release of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and decreased baseline vagal tone (regulated by the baroreceptors in the carotid arch, aortic arch, left atrium and pulmonary vessels)
- The cardiovascular system also responds by redistributing blood to the brain, heart and kidneys and away from the skin, muscle and GI tract.

##### Renal System
- Renal system responds to haemorrhagic shock by stimulating an increase in renin secretion from the juxtaglomerular apparatus. 
- Renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which subsequently is converted to angiotensin II by the lungs and liver
- Angiotensin II has two main effects, both of which help to reverse haemorrhagic shock: 
	1. vasoconstriction of arteriolar smooth muscle 
	2. stimulation of aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex
- Aldosterone is responsible for active sodium reabsorption and subsequent water conservation

##### Neuroendocrine System
- Neuroendocrine system responds to haemorrhagic shock by causing an increase in circulating ADH
- ADH is released from the posterior pituitary gland in response to a decrease in blood pressure (as detected by baroreceptors) and a decrease in the sodium concentration (as detected by osmoreceptors)
- ADH indirectly leads to an increased reabsorption of water and sodium by the distal tubule, collecting ducts and loop of Henle.


Questions 2.51-2.60
-------------------

70% = F: 53, 56, 57

### Q2.51
A 16-yo girl admitted with mitral stenosis (MS) caused by rheumatic heart disease. A rise in which of the following parameters is consistent with this patient's valvular lesion?

	A. Aortic pressure
	B. Cardiac output (CO)
	C. Left atrial pressure
	D. Left ventricular end-systolic volume (LV-ESV)
	E. Central venous pressure (CVP)	

#### Answer: C. Left atrial pressure - TRUE
- Mitral stenosis is a narrowing of the inlet valve into the left ventricle that prevents proper opening during diastolic filling. Patients with mitral stenosis typically have mitral valve leaflets that are thickened, commissures that are fused and/or chordae tendineae that are thickened and shortened. The most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic fever. About 40% of patients with rheumatic heart disease have isolated mitral stenosis. The normal area of the mitral valve orifice is 4–6cm2, which effectively creates a common chamber between the left atrium and the left ventricle in diastole. In early diastole, a small and brief pressure gradient is present, but, during most of the filling period, the pressures in the two chambers are equal. Narrowing of the valve area to less than 2.5cm2 impedes the free flow of blood and causes a build-up of left atrial pressure (LAP) to promote normal transmitral flow volume.
- Critical mitral stenosis occurs when the opening is reduced to 1cm2. At this stage, an LAP of 25mmHg is required to maintain a normal cardiac output. With progressive stenosis, critical flow restriction reduces left ventricular output. The increase in LAP also enlarges the left atrium and raises pulmonary venous and capillary pressures. The resulting pulmonary congestion and reduced cardiac output can mimic primary left ventricular failure, but left ventricular contractility is normal in most cases of mitral stenosis. As the disease evolves, chronic elevation of LAP eventually leads to pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid and pulmonary valve incompetence, and secondary right heart failure.

### Q2.52
You are looking at an ECG strip that show Sinus Bradycardia. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be associated with this ECG finding?

	A. Hypovolaemia
	B. Hypothermia
	C. Vasodilator therapy
	D. Injection of atropine
	E. Fever

#### Answer: B. Hypothermia - TRUE
- Sinus bradycardia can be defined as a sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of 60 beats/min or less. However, few patients actually become symptomatic until their heart rate drops to less than 50 beats/min. The action potential responsible for this rhythm arises from the sinus node and causes a P wave on the surface ECG that is normal in terms of both amplitude and vector. These P waves are typically followed by a normal QRS complex and T wave.
- Commonly, sinus bradycardia is an incidental finding in otherwise healthy individuals, particularly in athletes and young adults or sleeping patients. Apart from fit, but otherwise normal, individuals, there is a long list of situations where sinus bradycardia occurs, including:
	- Hypothermia
	- Increased vagal tone (as a result of vagal stimulation or drugs)
	- Hypothyroidism
	- β Blockade
	- Marked intracranial hypertension
	- Obstructive jaundice, and even in uraemia
	- Structural SA node disease or ischaemia
	- Sleep apnoea
	- Hypoglycaemia
	- Inferior wall myocardial infarction.

### Q2.53
A 48-yo woman presents to her doctor complaining of weakness and fatigue. On physical examination, her weight is up by 10 pounds (4.5 kg) compared with her last visit 6/12 ago. 

Name        | Value			| Range		|
------------|--------------:|----------:|
BP          | 160/100 mmHg	| 120/80

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

	A. Cushing’s syndrome
	B. Diabetes mellitus
	C. Phaeochromocytoma
	D. Primary aldosteronism
	E. Secondary aldosteronism

#### Answer: A. Cushing’s syndrome - *FALSE* = D. Primary aldosteronism - TRUE (Conn's syndrome)
- Primary aldosteronism (Conn’s syndrome) is a condition of hyperaldosteronism originating in the adrenal gland. The causes include an aldosterone-secreting adrenocortical adenoma, hyperplasia of the zona glomerulosa and, very rarely, an adrenal carcinoma. It is characterised by hypertension secondary to sodium retention, hypokalaemia and a decreased serum renin caused by a negative feedback of increased blood pressure on renin secretion.
- Cushing’s syndrome is the result of increased glucocorticoid production, particularly cortisol. Physical signs typically include ‘moon facies,’ truncal obesity, ‘buffalo hump’ and purple abdominal striae. Diabetes mellitus is a condition of inadequate insulin production that presents with hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis. Phaeochromocytoma is a rare tumour of chromaffin cells occurring most commonly in the adrenal medulla. The tumour secretes adrenaline and noradrenaline, resulting in secondary hypertension. Secondary aldosteronism results from an activation of the renin–angiotensin system caused by renal ischaemia, oedema and renal tumours. In contrast to primary aldosteronism, secondary aldosteronism is associated with increased serum renin.

### Q2.54
A patient is given an IV infusion of p-aminohippuric acid (PAH). After a short time:

Name       | Value		|
-----------|-----------:|
Plasma PAH | 0.02 mg/mL
Urine PAH  | 13 mg/mL
Urine flow | 1.0 mL/min

What is the effective renal plasma flow?

	A. 0.26 mL/min
	B. 26 mL/min
	C. 65 mL/min
	D. 260 mL/min
	E. 650 mL/min

#### Answer: E. 650 mL/min - TRUE
- renal plasma = 13/0.02 x 1.0 = 130/0.2 = 1300/2 = 650 mL/min
- Renal plasma flow can be determined by the principle of conservation and the use of a substance that is not synthesised or metabolised by the kidney. The amount of such a substance entering the kidney per unit time via the renal artery equals the amount leaving via the ureter and the renal vein. The difficulty of obtaining renal venous plasma samples limits the usefulness of this approach to measuring renal plasma flow. However, it has been found that the tubular secretory system for p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) is so efficient that at low plasma concentrations it removes 90% or more of the PAH from the plasma as it flows through the kidney. 
- Thus, for practical reasons, the 10% that remains in the renal vein is ignored and it is assumed that the amount entering the kidneys (renal plasma flow [RPF] × arterial concentration [PPAH]) equals the amount leaving via the ureters:
	- Urine concentration (UPAH) × Urine flow rate [V, ml/min], ie
		- RPF × PPAH = UPAH × V, and
		- RPF = UPAH × V/PPAH
- So, in this patient, substituting appropriate values, we have (13mg/ml × 1.0ml/min)/0.02mg/ml = 650ml/min.

### Q2.55
A 55-yo obese woman experience episodic abdominal pain. She notes that the _pain increases after the ingestion of a fatty meal_. The action of which of the following hormones is responsible for _intensification of her symptoms_.

	A. Cholecystokinin
	B. Gastrin
	C. Pepsin
	D. Secretin
	E. Somatostatin

#### Answer: A. Cholecystokinin - TRUE
- This woman has a risk profile (female, fat, 40s) and symptomatology consistent with gallstones (cholelithiasis). As would be expected, contraction of the gallbladder after a fatty meal often exacerbates the pain caused by gallstones. Cholecystokinin, the release of which is stimulated by dietary fat, is the hormone responsible for stimulation of gallbladder contraction. It is produced in I-cells of the duodenum and jejunum. In addition to gallbladder contraction, cholecystokinin also stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion and decreases the rate of gastric emptying.
- Gastrin is produced by the G-cells of the antrum and duodenum. Gastrin stimulates the secretion of HCl from the parietal cells and pepsinogen from the chief cells of the stomach. Gastrin secretion is stimulated by gastric distension, digestive products (eg amino acids) and vagal discharge. Pepsin is a protease produced by the chief cells of the stomach (as pepsinogen). It is involved in the digestion of proteins. Pepsinogen release is stimulated by vagal stimulation, gastrin, local acid production, secretin, cholecystokinin and histamine. Secretin is produced by the S-cells of the duodenum. It is secreted primarily in response to acidification of the duodenal mucosa. Secretin stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate-containing fluid from the pancreas and biliary ducts. This neutralisation allows pancreatic enzymes to function. Secretin also inhibits gastric acid production and gastric emptying. Somatostatin is produced by the D-cells of the pancreatic islets and in the gastric and intestinal mucosa. Somatostatin is an inhibitory hormone; it inhibits the secretion of most gastrointestinal hormones, gallbladder contraction, gastric acid and pepsinogen secretion, pancreatic and small intestinal fluid secretion and both glucagon and insulin release.

### Q2.56
Bile is a complex fluid containing water, electrolytes, and a battery of organic molecules including bile acids, cholesterol, phospholipids and bilirubin, which flows through the biliary tract into the small intestine. Which of the following statements about bile is true?

	A. Adult humans produce about 150–200ml of bile daily
	B. Bile acids are derivatives of cholesterol synthesised in the hepatocytes
	C. Hepatocytes add bicarbonate to the bile
	D. Bile salts are purely hydrophobic
	E. Of the bile acids delivered to the duodenum 5% are absorbed back into the blood within the ileum
	
#### Answer: E. Of the bile acids delivered to the duodenum 5% are absorbed back into the blood within the ileum - *FALSE* = B. Bile acids are derivatives of cholesterol synthesised in the hepatocytes - TRUE
- Adult humans produce 400–800ml of bile daily
- Secretion of bile can be considered to occur in two stages:
	1. Hepatocytes secrete bile into canaliculi from which it flows into bile ducts
		- This hepatic bile contains large quantities of bile acids, cholesterol and other organic molecules
	2. As bile flows through the bile ducts it is modified by addition of a watery, bicarbonate-rich secretion
	 	- from ductal epithelial cells
 
##### Notes
- Bile acids are derivatives of cholesterol synthesised in the hepatocyte
- Cholesterol, ingested as part of the diet or derived from hepatic synthesis, is converted into the bile acids cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids, which are then conjugated to an amino acid (glycine or taurine) to yield the conjugated form that is actively secreted into the canaliculi
- Bile acids are facial amphipathic, ie they contain both hydrophobic (lipid soluble) and polar (hydrophilic) faces
- The cholesterol-derived portion of a bile acid has one face that is hydrophobic (the one with methyl groups) and one that is hydrophilic (the one with the hydroxyl groups); the amino acid conjugate is polar and hydrophilic
- Their amphipathic nature enables bile acids to emulsify lipid aggregates. Bile acids have detergent action on particles of dietary fat, which causes fat globules to break down or be emulsified into minute, microscopic droplets
- Emulsification is not digestion as such, but is of importance because it greatly increases the surface area of fat, making it available for digestion by lipases, which cannot access the inside of lipid droplets.
- Bile acids are also lipid carriers and are able to solubilise many lipids by forming micelles – aggregates of lipids such as fatty acids, cholesterol and monoglycerides – that remain suspended in water
- Bile acids are also critical for transport and absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins
- Large amounts of bile acids are secreted into the intestine every day, but only relatively small quantities are lost from the body
- **NOTE** 95% of bile acids delivered to duodenum are absorbed back into the blood within ileum
- Venous blood from the ileum goes straight into the portal vein, and hence through the sinusoids of the liver
- Hepatocytes extract bile acids very efficiently from sinusoidal blood and little escapes the healthy liver into the systemic circulation
- Bile acids are then transported across the hepatocytes to be re-secreted into the canaliculi
- Net effect of this enterohepatic recirculation is that each bile salt molecule is reused about 20 times
	- Often two or three times during a single digestive phase

### Q2.57
A 25-yo man has cholecystokinin deficiency as a component of an autoimmune polyglandular syndrome. Which of the following effects is likely to be seen in this patient as a result of _cholecystokinin deficiency_?

	A. Increased pancreatic enzyme secretion
	B. Enhanced gallbladder contraction
	C. Contraction of the Sphincter of Oddi
	D. Inhibition of gastric emptying
	E. Stimulation of small bowel motility

#### Answer: A. Increased pancreatic enzyme secretion - *FALSE* = C. Contraction of the Sphincter of Oddi - TRUE
- Cholecystokinin plays a key role in facilitating digestion within small intestine
- It is secreted from mucosal epithelial cells in first segment of the small intestine (*duodenum*)
	- Stimulates delivery into small intestine of digestive enzymes from pancreas and bile from gallbladder
- It is a linear peptide that is synthesised as a pre-prohormone, and then 
	- Proteolytically cleaved to generate a family of peptides with same carboxy ends

##### Actions of Cholecystokinin
- Partially digested fats and proteins in lumen of the duodenum release cholecystokinin which:
	1. Stimulates secretion of pancreatic enzymes
	2. Stimulates gallbladder contraction
	3. Relaxes the sphincter of oddi
	4. Inhibits gastric emptying
	5. Stimulates small bowel motility	
	6. Enhances secretin stimulation of pancreatic bicarbonate secretion.

### Q2.58
A 55-yo man with gradual onset of weight loss, diarrhoea, stomatitis and a necrolytic migrating erythema develops diabetes mellitus. On investigation he is diagnosed as having a _tumour of the cells of the pancreas_. Which of the following physiological abnormalities is most likely to be present in this patient?

	A. Inhibition of gluconeogenesis
	B. Inhibition of lipolysis
	C. Inhibition of catecholamine secretion
	D. Activation of glycogenolysis
	E. Stimulation of gastric secreting activity

#### Answer: D. Activation of glycogenolysis - TRUE
- The clinical presentation is classic for a glucagonoma, which is a rare neuroendocrine tumour with almost exclusive pancreatic localisation. Malignant glucagonomas are islet cell pancreatic tumours that are discovered because of the glucagonoma syndrome or local mass effects, or incidentally. Glucagonomas originate from the 2 cells of the pancreas. This tumour is characterised by glucagon overproduction, diabetes mellitus, hypoaminoacidaemia, weight loss, normochromic and normocytic anaemia, and a necrolytic migrating erythema, which is the most characteristic clinical sign of this pathology. 
- Physiological glucagon activity includes:
	- Activation of gluconeogenesis
	- Stimulation of lipolysis
	- Stimulation of catecholamine secretion
	- Activation of glycogenolysis with contemporary glycolysis inhibition
	- Inhibition of the gastric secreting activity
	- Inhibition of the pancreatic secreting activity
	- Inhibition of the gastrointestinal motility
	- Stimulation of urinary excretion of water and phosphates as well as Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+
- When glucagon production is a result of a secreting tumour, it becomes independent and loses the feedback control mechanisms, and the subsequent increase of glucagon concentration in the blood causes the symptoms. Diabetes mellitus occurs in patients with a glucagonoma because of the lack of equilibrium between insulin production and glucagon production, which occurs when there are high serum levels of glucagon and normal levels of insulin or when insulin production is reduced and a normal glucagon level is present. However, glucagon may not induce hyperglycaemia directly unless metabolism of glucose by the liver is compromised directly.

### Q2.59
A 46-yo man with a _mechanical mitral valve_ and atrial fibrillation (AF) developed mesenteric ischaemia as a result of thromboembolism from the valve. Upon exploratory laparotomy the whole of the _jejunum was noticed to be gangrenous and resected_. Absorption of which of the following substances is likely to be affected in this patient?

	A. Vitamin B12 - F
	B. Water - F
	C. Electrolytes
	D. Bile salts - F
	E. Fat-soluble vitamins
	
#### Answer: E. Fat-soluble vitamins - TRUE
- Macronutrients and micronutrients are absorbed along the length of the small intestine. However, as the jejunum has taller villi, deeper crypts and greater enzyme activity compared with the ileum under normal conditions, about 90% of digestion and absorption of significant macronutrients and micronutrients are accomplished in the proximal 100–150cm of the jejunum. This includes absorption of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins B and C and folic acid, and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K.
- The ileum is the site for absorption of water and electrolytes. In addition, the terminal ileum is the site of absorption of bile salts and vitamin B12. Water is also absorbed from the colon. Colonic water absorption could be increased to as much as five times its normal capacity after small bowel resection.

### Q2.60
After a total hip replacement (THR) a 78-yo woman developed a pulmonary embolism (PE) that caused _obstruction of a branch of the pulmonary artery_. Which of the following is likely to increase in this patient?

	A. Ventilation/perfusion ratio
	B. Lung volume
	C. Arterial CO2
	D. Arterial O2
	E. Alveolar O2 saturation

#### Answer: A. Ventilation/perfusion ratio - TRUE
- The pathophysiological changes that follow pulmonary embolism (PE) involve derangements in pulmonary haemodynamics, gas exchange and mechanics. The change in cardiopulmonary function is proportional to the extent of obstruction, which varies with the size and number of emboli obstructing the pulmonary arteries, and to the patient’s pre-embolic cardiopulmonary status. The resulting physiological changes may include pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular failure and shock, dyspnoea with tachypnoea and hyperventilation, arterial hypoxaemia and pulmonary infarction. Tachypnoea, often with dyspnoea, almost always occurs after a PE. It appears to be a result of stimulation of juxtacapillary receptors in the alveolar capillary membrane by swelling of the alveolar interstitial space. This stimulation increases reflex vagal afferent activity, which stimulates medullary respiratory neurons. Consequent alveolar hyperventilation is manifested by a lowered Paco2. After occlusion of the pulmonary artery, areas of the lung are ventilated but not perfused, resulting in wasted ventilation with an increased ventilation/perfusion ratio – the physiological hallmark of PE – contributing further to the hyperventilatory state. Depletion of alveolar surfactant within hours of the embolic event results in diminished lung volume and compliance. Reduced lung volume secondary to atelectasis or infarction after PE may be manifest on the chest radiograph by diaphragmatic elevation. Diminished lung volume and possibly lowered airway Paco2 may induce bronchoconstriction, leading to expiratory wheezing. Arterial hypoxaemia typically occurs with diminished arterial O2 saturation (Sao2 from 94% to 85%), although the Sao2 may be normal. Hypoxaemia is caused by right-to-left shunting in areas of partial or complete atelectasis not affected by embolisation. A ventilation/perfusion imbalance probably also contributes to hypoxaemia. The mechanisms responsible for the ventilation/perfusion imbalance and atelectasis are not fully defined. In massive PE, severe hypoxaemia may result from right atrial hypertension that causes right-to-left shunting of blood through a patent foramen ovale. Low venous O2 tension may also contribute to development of arterial hypoxaemia.

Questions 2.61-2.70
-------------------

50% - F: 63, 66, 67, 68, 70

### Q2.61
A woman pulled from a fire is _markedly hypoxic_. Respiration in this patient will be rapidly influenced by hypoxia through its _stimulatory effect_:

	A. Directly on the medullary respiratory neurons
	B. Directly on the pulmonary mechanoreceptors
	C. On the central chemoreceptors
	D. On the carotid and aortic chemoreceptors
	E. Directly on the Hb–O2 dissociation curve

#### Answer: D. On the carotid and aortic chemoreceptors - TRUE
- Carotid and aortic bodies are able to monitor 
	1. Physically dissolved O2 and CO2 and 
	2. H+ concentration of arterial blood
- These chemoreceptors are stimulated by &darr; PO2, especially when it falls below 8kPa (60mmHg)
- They are also stimulated by an 
	- increase in the arterial blood H+ concentration (decreased pH), or
	- increase in physically dissolved CO2 (or PCO2)
- Although it is not clear precisely how increases in H+ or CO2 or decreases in the PO2 stimulate the chemoreceptor
	- **NOTE** Peripheral chemoreceptors are **only sensors** capable of detecting a fall in PO2
	- Thus, the peripheral chemoreceptors account for increases in ventilation resulting from hypoxia
	- However, these chemoreceptors detect only levels of physically dissolved O2
		- and not O2 that is *chemically attached to haemoglobin*
- **NOTE** In contrast to peripheral receptors
	- Central chemoreceptors are **not sensitive** to changes in PO2 of cerebral blood or CSF

### Q2.62
A 66-yo man who is a chronic smoker is admitted for elective repair of a right-sided indirect inguinal hernia. His clinical examination and chest radiological findings are consistent with _chronic obstructive airway disease_. He is sent for _pulmonary function tests_ (PFTs). 

Which of the following abnormalities is most likely to be present in this patients?

	A. Increased FEV1/FVC (forced expiratory volume in 1s/forced vital capacity) - F
	B. Decreased total lung capacity (TLC) - F
	C. Increased residual volume (RV)
	D. Decreased functional residual capacity (FRC) - F
	E. Increased carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) - F
	
#### Answer: C. Increased residual volume (RV) - TRUE
- The best diagnostic test for evaluating patients with suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is lung function measured with spirometry. Key spirometric measures may be obtained with a portable office spirometer and should include forced vital capacity (FVC) and the normal forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (FEV1). The ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) normally exceeds 0.75. Patients with COPD typically present with obstructive airflow. A FEV1/FVC ratio <70% in a patient with a postbronchodilator FEV1 <80% of the predicted value is diagnostic for COPD. Severity is further stratified based on symptoms and FEV1 values. A patient with severe disease has a FEV1 <50% of the predicted value; values below 30% of the predicted value represent very severe disease. Beyond office spirometry, complete pulmonary function testing may show increased total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV). A substantial loss of lung surface area available for effective oxygen exchange causes diminished carbon monoxide diffusion in the lung (DLCO) in patients with emphysema. This finding may help distinguish COPD from asthma, because patients with asthma typically have normal DLCO values.

### Q2.63
A patient with _deteriorating renal function_ is to undergo estimation of his glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Which of the *following substances* will be the best choice for the *estimation of GFR* in this patient?

	A. Urea
	B. Inulin
	C. PAH
	D. Creatinine
	E. 51Cr-labelled EDTA
	
#### Answer: D. Creatinine - *FALSE* = B. Inulin - TRUE
- The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is generally considered the best measure of renal function 
	- despite the fact that the kidney performs an array of duties, including 
		1. salt and water balance
		2. erythropoiesis
		3. bone metabolism
		4. electrolyte homeostasis
		5. blood pressure control
- GFR is traditionally measured as the renal clearance of a particular substance from plasma and is expressed as the volume of plasma that can be completely cleared of that substance in a unit of time
- Ideal marker for GFR determinations would 
	- appear endogenously in the plasma at a constant rate
	- be freely filtered at the glomerulus
	- be neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the renal tubule
	- undergo no extrarenal elimination

##### Calculation of GFR
- GFR is calculated as
	- Ux = concentration of x in a timed urine collection (mg/ml)
	- V = volume of urine per unit time (ml/min)
	- Px = concentration of x in plasma (mg/ml)
	- UxV = rate of urinary excretion of x = excreted load (mg/min)
	- Cx = (Ux * V)/Px = the (plasma) clearance of x (ml/min)
 
- Cx is the volume of plasma containing x that would have to be completely cleared of x per unit time to supply an amount of x for urinary excretion at the measured rate. Clearance does not necessarily mean that an actual volume of plasma is, in fact, completely cleared of x. Rather, it refers to a ‘virtual volume’ of plasma that would provide the measured amount of x.
- A substance that is freely filtered and undergoes neither reabsorption nor secretion will have a clearance equal to the GFR. The clearance of inulin, a carbohydrate polymer of fructose, measured during a constant infusion, is the standard for measurement of GFR. A clearance greater than that of inulin indicates that a substance also undergoes tubular secretion; a clearance less than that of inulin implies tubular reabsorption.
- Rewriting the clearance equation for x:inulin, we have:
	- Cinulin:Uinulin × V/Pinulin
 
- As a result of the difficulty in performing inulin clearance, the clearance of endogenous creatinine is used for clinical purposes as an estimate of the GFR. Its plasma concentration remains stable during a 24-hour period and its rate of excretion does not vary with urine flow. Thus, creatinine clearance (Ccr) can be calculated during a 24-hour collection of urine, with a plasma sample obtained at any time during the collection period. In a normal man, filtered creatinine does not undergo tubular reabsorption; some tubular secretion does occur. At the plasma creatinine concentration that prevails at a normal GFR, the ration Ccr/Cinulin is close to 1, implying negligible secretion. At progressively lower GFRs, however, tubular secretion plays an increasingly important part in creatinine excretion. At GFRs <30ml/ min, Ccr may overestimate Cinulin by 50–80%.
- Blood urea is generally recognised to be a poor measure of renal function, in that it possesses few of the attributes of an ideal marker of GFR. It is produced at variable rates, is affected by a number of disease states (congestive heart failure, malnutrition, hyperalimentation) and undergoes renal tubular reabsorption. PAH is used for estimation of the renal plasma flow rate. 51Cr-labelled EDTA, has been used as a reliable measure of glomerular filtration but is costly, involves special specimen handling and requires radiation exposure.

### Q2.64
A 76-yo woman undergoes sigmoid colectomy for _ruptured diverticulum_. Her baseline BP is 140/80 mmHg. She requires multiple boluses of phenylephrine in the operating room to support her BP. On return to ICU, the patient is mechanically ventilated and her BP is 90/50 mmHg. Her urinary output is 15mL in the first hour. Which of the following is the best strategy to _improve her urine output_?

	A. Start infusion of an inotrope
	B. Give intravenous corticosteroids
	C. Insert a Swan–Ganz catheter
	D. Use a stroke volume monitor
	E. Fluid challenge followed by vasopressor

#### Answer: E. Fluid challenge followed by vasopressor - TRUE
- Oliguria is hypotension or hypovolaemia until otherwise proved. This patient is likely to be hypovolaemic as well as vasoplegic secondary to fluid loss in the abdomen and release of inflammatory mediators (particularly inducible nitric oxide synthase) as a result of faecal soiling. The best strategy will be to give her a fluid challenge with 200–250ml of colloid solution followed by infusion of noradrenaline, which is a vasopressor. Unless the low urinary output is the result of poor cardiac performance, there is little to be learned by insertion of a Swan–Ganz catheter. If there is concern that this patient had a history of coronary arterial disease, and may have had a perioperative myocardial event, a stroke volume monitor may be useful. Inotrope may be indicated if the patient has poor ventricular function. Corticosteroids have no role in this clinical scenario.

### Q2.65
A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension (usual BP 150/90) and intermittent atrial fibrillation is admitted to the Emergency Department with a 6-hour history of a _painful white leg_. A large embolus is located in his left internal iliac artery, with distal ischaemia. He is brought to the operating room for embolectomy– revascularisation. Just before induction his BP is 200/100mmHg, which is treated with a labetalol infusion. Once circulation to the affected limb is re-established successfully, the BP falls to 160/90mmHg and the labetalol infusion is stopped. The patient is otherwise stable and is returned to the ICU postoperatively. Preoperatively his creatinine was 1.1mg/dl; 6 h postoperatively it was 1.8mg/dl. His urine was noticed to be tea coloured. The next morning the patient becomes anuric with a creatinine of 2.5mg/dl. His potassium is 6.8mmol/L and phosphate 1.9mmol/L. There is no evidence of postrenal obstruction. He is started on continuous haemofiltration. Which of the following is the _most likely cause for this patient’s acute renal failure_?

	A. Systemic hypertension
	B. Labetalol infusion
	C. Rhabdomyolyis
	D. Hyperkalaemia
	E. Atrial fibrillation

#### Answer: C. Rhabdomyolyis - TRUE
- The diagnosis is acute rhabdomyolysis after reperfusion. The ischaemia–reperfusion injury causes swelling and destruction of muscle cells, leading to the release of cellular contents into the circulation. The mechanism of injury appears to be calcium influx, free radical generation, disruption of the microcirculation, and release of cytotoxic materials and proteases into the local environment. The result is acidosis, hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia and a massive increase in circulating myoglobin levels. Usually myoglobin is reabsorbed by the proximal tubule and metabolised, releasing free iron that is soaked up by glutathione, but in rhabdomyolysis this mechanism is overwhelmed. Free iron generates free radicals, which are nephrotoxic. In addition, in the presence of acidic urine, myoglobin binds with a renal excretory protein (Tamm–Horsfall) to form casts that obstruct the tubules and cause acute tubular necrosis. The diagnosis can be made by measuring serum creatine kinase levels and checking urinary myoglobin (the urine is usually tea coloured).

### Q2.66 - LEARN
A 26-yo man falls from a ladder and sustains injury to the back of his neck. Computed tomography (CT) reveals a bony fragment that penetrated the _lateral portion of the dorsal columns_. Which of the following functions is most likely to affected by this lesion?

	A. Vibratory sensations from the ipsilateral arm
	B. Fine motor control of the ipsilateral fingers
	C. Motor control of the contralateral foot
	D. Sweating of the ipsilateral face
	E. Proprioception from the ipsilateral leg
	
#### Answer: C. Motor control of the contralateral foot - *FALSE* = A. Vibratory sensations from the ipsilateral arm - TRUE
- Damage to *fasciculus cuneatus* would result in a 
	- deficit in tactile, proprioceptive and vibratory sensations in ipsilateral arm
	- as fibres that carry this information *do not cross until they reach medulla*

##### Notes
- At this level, lateral portion of dorsal columns (*dorsal funiculus*) 
	- is composed of fasciculus cuneatus 
- Axons carrying 
	- *tactile*
	- *proprioceptive*, and 
	- *vibratory* information from ipsilateral arm 
		- enter spinal cord via dorsal root
		- ascend cord in *fasciculus cuneatus* and synapse in *nucleus cuneatus* of *caudal medulla*
- Secondary neurons from this nucleus give rise to internal arcuate fibres
	which decussate and ascend to thalamus (*ventral posterolateral nucleus*) as medial lemniscus
- Tertiary neurons from VPN project to ipsilateral somatosensory cortex 

###### Corticospinal Tracts - LEARN
- Fine motor control of fingers is principally carried by 
	- *ipsilateral corticospinal tract* in lateral funiculus of cord
- Motor control of **contralateral** foot is carried by 
	- ipsilateral corticospinal tract in lateral funiculus of cord
- Hemianhidrosis (*lack of sweating*) of face could be produced by 
	- interruption of sympathetic innervation to face
- *Hypothalamospinal tract* projects from hypothalamus to 
	- intermediolateral cell column at levels T1–2
	- It descends the cord in lateral funiculus
		- Interruption of this tract results in Horner’s syndrome 
			1. *miosis*
			2. *ptosis*
			3. *hemianhidrosis*
- Proprioception from ipsilateral leg is carried by 
	*fasciculus gracilis* in medial part of dorsal columns

### Q2.67
A 55-yr old man is admitted to an ICU with _acute respiratory distress syndrome_ (ARDS). Which of the following variables is most likely to be _lower than normal_ in this patient?

	A. Oncotic pressure of alveolar fluid
	B. Work of breathing
	C. Lung compliance
	D. Alveolar–arterial pressure difference
	E. Surface tension of alveolar fluid
	
#### Answer: E. Surface tension of alveolar fluid - *FALSE* = C. Lung compliance - TRUE
- Decrease in lung compliance is secondary to **increased lung recoil pressure of oedematous lung**
	- which clinically increases work of breathing and *leads to respiratory muscle fatigue*

##### Notes
- Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) starts with 
	- damage to the alveolar epithelium and vascular endothelium resulting in 
	- increased permeability to plasma and inflammatory cells into interstitium and alveolar space and in lung oedema
- Damage to surfactant-producing type II cells and presence of protein-rich fluid in alveolar space 
	- disrupt production and function of pulmonary surfactant
	- leading to microatelectasis and impaired gas exchange
- The pathophysiological consequences of lung oedema in ARDS include a decrease in lung volumes 
	compliance and large intrapulmonary shunts (blood perfusing unventilated segments of lung)
- A fall in RV is uniformly present and contributes to ventilation/perfusion inequality
- It has been hypothesised that a defective surfactant may be partially responsible for the small lung volumes 
	- it may worsen oedema accumulation in ARDS 
	- increases in alveolar surface tension have been shown to increase lung water content 
		- by lowering interstitial hydrostatic pressure and increasing interstitital oncotic pressure 

### Q2.68
A 43-yo man has a parathyroid adenoma producing elevated levels of parathyroid hormone. Which of the following statements about _parathyroid hormone_ (PTH) is true?

	A. Increased ionised calcium levels are essential for its release
	B. It causes increased deposition of calcium in bones - F
	C. It stimulates production of the active form of vitamin D in the small intestine
	D. It stimulates loss of phosphate ions in the urine
	E. It stimulates excretion of calcium in the urine
	
#### Answer: C. It stimulates production of the active form of vitamin D in the small intestine - *FALSE* = D. It stimulates loss of phosphate ions in the urine - TRUE
- Parathyroid hormone is most important endocrine regulator of calcium and phosphorus concentration in extracellular fluid
	- It is secreted from cells of parathyroid glands and finds its major target cells in bone and kidneys
- It stimulates osteoclasts to resorb bone mineral, liberating calcium into blood
- It facilitates calcium absorption from small intestine indirectly by 
	- stimulating production of *active form of vitamin D in kidney*
- Vitamin D induces synthesis of a calcium-binding protein in intestinal epithelial cells
	- which facilitates efficient absorption of calcium into the blood
- In addition to stimulating fluxes of calcium into blood from bone and intestine
	- parathyroid hormone puts a brake on excretion of calcium in urine
	- thus conserving calcium in blood
- This effect is mediated by *stimulating tubular reabsorption of calcium*
	- **NOTE** Another effect is to *stimulate loss of phosphate ions in urine*

##### Notes
- Parathyroid hormone is released in response to low extracellular concentrations of free calcium
- Changes in blood phosphate concentration can be associated with changes in parathyroid hormone secretion
	- but this appears to be an indirect effect
	- as phosphate itself is not a significant regulator of PTH
- When *calcium concentrations fall below normal range*
	there is a steep increase in secretion of parathyroid hormone
- Low levels of the hormone are secreted even when blood calcium levels are high

### Q2.69
Hypoxia generally causes vasodilatation in arterial beds. In which organ does _hypoxia cause vasoconstriction of arterial beds_?

	A. Skeletal muscle
	B. Heart
	C. Kidney
	D. Gut
	E. Lungs
	
#### Answer: E. Lungs - TRUE
- *Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction* is a local response to hypoxia resulting primarily
	- from constriction of small muscular pulmonary arteries 
	- in response to reduced alveolar oxygen tension
- This unique response of pulmonary arterioles results in a local adjustment of perfusion to ventilation
- This means that, if a bronchiole is obstructed
	- lack of oxygen causes contraction of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle in corresponding area
	- shunting blood away from hypoxic region to better-ventilated regions

##### Notes
- Skeletal muscle, heart, kidney and gut arteries *all dilate under hypoxic conditions*
	- resulting in increased blood flow to these organs

### Q2.70
Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a naturally occurring thrombolytic substance. The thrombolytic mechanism of action of tPA involves:

	A. Proteolytic breakdown of fibrin
	B. Direct conversion of plasminogen to plasmin
	C. Depletion of α2-antiplasmin
	D. Proteolytic activation of fibrinogen
	E. Formation of an active complex with plasminogen

#### Answer: D. Proteolytic activation of fibrinogen - *FALSE* = B. Direct conversion of plasminogen to plasmin - TRUE
- tPA *directly catalyses **proteolytic conversion of plasminogen to plasmin*

##### Notes
- Alteplase (tPA, Activase) was first recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator
	- it identical to native tissue plasminogen activator
- In vivo, tissue-type plasminogen activator is synthesised and made available by cells of the vascular endothelium
- Plasminogen activator is physiological thrombolytic agent 
	- responsible for most of body’s natural efforts to prevent excessive thrombus propagation
- Alteplase is fibrinolytic agent most familiar to the Emergency Department 
	-it is lytic agent most often used for treatment of 
		1. coronary artery 
		2. thrombosispulmonary embolism
		3. acute stroke
- In theory, alteplase should be effective only at the surface of fibrin clot
- In practice, however, a systemic lytic state is seen
	- with moderate amounts of circulating fibrin degradation products 
	- and a substantial systemic bleeding risk
- The agent may be readministered as necessary
	- because it is not antigenic and almost *never associated with any allergic manifestations*

### Q2.71
The _liver function tests_ of a patient show hyPERbilirubinaemia. The bilirubin is predominantly conjugated. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be associated with an _increase in conjugated bilirubin_?

	A. Physiological jaundice of the newborn
	B. Haemolysis caused by rhesus incompatibility
	C. Acute haemolytic crisis in sickle cell disease
	D. Obstructive jaundice resulting from carcinoma of the head of the pancreas
	E. Gilbert’s syndrome
	
#### Answer: D. Obstructive jaundice resulting from carcinoma of the head of the pancreas - TRUE
- Bilirubin is a tetrapyrrole created by the normal breakdown of haem. Most bilirubin is produced during the breakdown of haemoglobin and other haemoproteins. Accumulation of bilirubin or its conjugates in body tissues produces jaundice, which is characterised by high plasma bilirubin levels and deposition of yellow bilirubin pigments in the skin, sclerae, mucous membranes and other less visible tissues. As bilirubin is highly insoluble in water, it must be converted into a soluble conjugate before elimination from the body. In the liver, uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronyl transferase converts bilirubin to a mixture of monoglucuronides and diglucuronides, referred to as conjugated (direct) bilirubin, which is then secreted into the bile by an ATP-dependent transporter. This process is highly efficient under normal conditions, so plasma unconjugated bilirubin concentrations remain low. Normal serum values of total bilirubin are typically 0.2–1mg/dl (3.4–17.1mmol/L), of which no more than 0.2mg/dl (3.4mmol/L) directly reacts. Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia results from reduced secretion of conjugated bilirubin into the bile, as occurs in patients with hepatitis, or from impaired flow of bile into the intestine, as occurs in patients with biliary obstruction caused by tumours in the head of the pancreas. Bile formation is very sensitive to a variety of hepatic insults, including high levels of inflammatory cytokines as may occur in patients with septic shock. Diseases that increase the rate of bilirubin formation, such as haemolysis, or diseases that reduce the rate of bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert’s syndrome, produce unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

### Q2.72
A 22-yo man with aortic stenosis caused by a congenital bicuspid valve is to undergo aortic valve replacement. On pre-operative assessment the oxygen consumption in this patient is 300 mL/min, arterial O2 content 20mL/100mL blood, pulmonary arterial content 15mL/100mL blood and his HR 100 beats/min. What is the _cardiac stroke volume_ in this patient?

	A.   1 mL
	B.  10 mL
	C.  60 mL
	D. 100 mL
	E. 200 mL
	
#### Answer: C.  60 mL (*Guess*) - TRUE
- CO = SV x HR 
- 5 mL/100mL consumed, 300/5 = 60

- Stroke volume is calculated by using the following formula:
	- Cardiac output (CO) = Stroke volume (SV) × Heart rate (HR)
- Cardiac output is calculated by using the following formula based on Fick’s principle:
	- VO2 = Q (Cao2 – Cvo2) where 
 		- VO2 is oxygen consumption
 		- Q-cardiac output
 		- Cao2 = arterial oxygen content 
 		- Cvo2 = mixed venous oxygen content
- Substituting the values in this formula we get:
	- 300ml/min = Q × [(20 – 15)ml]/100ml
	- Q = [(300 × 100)/5]ml/min
	- Q = 6000ml/min
- Next, stroke volume (SV) is calculated as follows:
	- 6000ml/min = SV × 100 beats/min
	- SV = [6000/100]ml/min
	- SV = 60ml/min

### Q2.73
A patient with a ruptured spleen and fractured pelvis as a result of a RTA arrives in the ED in a state of shock. Which of the following organs with the _largest specific blood flow per gram of tissue_ under resting conditions is most vulnerable in this patient?

	A. Kidney
	B. Heart
	C. Brain
	D. Skin
	E. Skeletal muscle
	
#### Answer: A. Kidney - TRUE
- Under normal resting conditions, about 5% of the cardiac output goes to the heart, 15% to the brain, 20% to the skin and skeletal muscles, 30% to the gastrointestinal tract and 20% to the kidneys. However, when normalised by weight, the kidneys receive the largest specific blood flow (400ml/min per 100g) at rest and are particularly at risk during haemorrhagic shock. The brain also receives a relatively high specific blood flow (50ml/min per 100g) as does the heart (60ml/min per 100g). Blood flow through the skin varies between 1 and 100ml/min per 100g and serves temperature regulation. Skeletal muscle under resting conditions has low specific blood flow ranging between 1 and 2ml/min per 100g which may increase up to 20-fold during heavy exercise.

### Q2.74
A 13-yo boy is Dx with a growth hormone (GH)-secreting tumour of the anterior pituitary gland. Which of the following _metabolic effects resulting from increased GH secretion_ is most likely to be enhanced in this patient?

	A. Decreased amino acid uptake
	B. Enhanced oxidation of proteins
	C. Enhanced triglyceride synthesis
	D. Decreased fat oxidation in adipocytes
	E. Enhanced glucose synthesis in the liver
 
#### Answer: B. Enhanced oxidation of proteins - *FALSE* = E. Enhanced glucose synthesis in the liver - TRUE
- Growth hormone (GH), also known as somatotrophin, is a protein hormone of about 190 amino acids 
	- that is synthesised and secreted by cells called somatotrophs in the anterior pituitary
- It is a major participant in control of several complex physiological processes
	- including growth and metabolism. GH is also of considerable interest as a drug used in both humans and animals
- It has important effects on protein, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism
- In general, GH stimulates protein anabolism in many tissues, such as
	1. &uarr; *amino acid uptake*
	2. &uarr; *protein synthesis*
	3. &darr; *oxidation of proteins*
- GH also *enhances utilisation of fat* by stimulating triglyceride breakdown and oxidation in adipocytes
- It is one of a battery of hormones that serves to maintain blood glucose within a normal range
- GH is often said to have anti-insulin activity, because it
	1. &darr; ability of insulin to stimulate uptake of glucose in peripheral tissues
	2. &uarr; **glucose synthesis in liver**

### Q2.75
A *steel furnace worker* is admitted to ED with _severe acute dehydration_. This patient is most likely to have:

	A. High renal water excretion
	B. Low permeability of collecting duct tubular cells for water
	C. Low plasma ADH levels
	D. Decreased baroreceptor firing rate 
	E. Decreased plasma osmolality
	
#### Answer: A. High renal water excretion - *FALSE* = D. Decreased baroreceptor firing rate - TRUE
- Dehydration = state of negative fluid balance that may be caused by 
	1. &darr; intake
	2. &uarr; output (renal, gastrointestinal or insensible losses), or
	3. fluid shift (ascites, effusions and capillary leak states such as burns and sepsis)
- &darr; in total body water (TBW) causes &darr; intracellular and &darr; extracellular fluid
- *NOTE* Clinical manifestations of dehydration are most closely related to intravascular volume depletion
- As dehydration progresses
	- hypovolaemic shock ultimately ensues
	- resulting in end-organ failure and death
- In *acute dehydration*, plasma osmolality &uarr; as more water than salt is lost
	- &darr; in total body water and plasma volume leads to 
	- *an inhibition of baroreceptors = lower firing rate*
- &uarr; plasma osmolality leads to 
	&uarr; ADH secretion and high plasma ADH levels, which 
	&uarr; water permeability of collecting duct cells
- This leads to more absorption of water by kidneys and *low renal water excretion*

### Q2.76
Omeprazole is an acid-activated prodrug that binds covalently to the proton pump located at the apical membrane of the gastric parietal cells, resulting in its irreversible inactivation. Which of the following is the _site of action of omeprazole_?

	A. Active H+ and Cl– co-transport
	B. H+/K+ ATPase
	C. Cl–/HCO3– exchange
	D. Passive diffusion of H+
	E. Na+/K+ pump
	
#### Answer: B. H+/K+ ATPase - TRUE
- The key player in acid secretion is a H+/K+ ATPase or ‘proton pump’ located in the canalicular membrane. This ATPase is magnesium dependent and not inhibited by ouabain. Parietal cells secrete an essentially isotonic solution of pure hydrochloric acid (HCl) containing 150mmol/L Cl– and 150mmol/L H+ (pH <1). Intracellular H+ of parietal cells is 10–4 mol/L (pH = 7.0) and active transport is necessary to transport H+ against this gradient. This is achieved by H+/K+ ATPase in the apical membrane, which exchanges H+ for K+.

### Q2.77
When a patient has a *lower than normal haemoglobin*, it is important to determine whether RBCs are of normal size and whether they have a normal concentration of Hb. These measurements, known as *erythrocyte or RBC indices*, provide important information above various types of anaemia. Which of the following is correct?

	A. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) = Haematocrit × Total RBC count
	B. MCV = Hb × Total RBC count
	C. Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) = Haemoglobin × [Total RBC count/100]
	D. MCH concentration (MCHC) = [Haemoglobin/Haematocrit] × 100
	E. MCHC = Haemoglobin/Total RBC count
	
#### Answer: E. MCHC = Haemoglobin/Total RBC count - *FALSE* = D. MCH concentration (MCHC) = [Haemoglobin/Haematocrit] × 100 - TRUE

##### Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
- Measures the mean or average size of individual RBCs - 
	- Size of average RBC (MCV) = total haematocrit / total RBC count
- &darr; MCV = RBCs are microcytic
	1. Iron deficiency anaemia
	2. Lead poisoning 
	3. Genetic diseases (thalassaemia major and minor)
- &uarr; MCV = RBCs are macrocytic
	1. B12 deficiency (pernicious anaemia)
	2. Folic acid deficiencies
- Normal MCV = RBCs are normocytic
	1. acute haemorrhage

##### Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin (MCH) 
- Measures the amount, or the mass, of haemoglobin present in one RBC
	- Haemoglobin in average cell (MCH) = total haemoglobin / total RBC count
- Result reported in picograms

##### Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) 
- Measures proportion of each cell taken up by haemoglobin
	- Proportion of RBC that is haemoglobin = (haemoglobin / haematocrit) x 100
- Result reported in *percentages*
The MCH and MCHC are used to assess whether RBCs are normochromic, hypochromic or hyperchromic. 
- **NOTE** MCHC < 32% => &darr: RBCs haemoglobin concentration = *iron deficiency anaemia*

##### Normal Erythrocyte Indices - LEARN
- Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
	- men   = 80–98 fL
	- women = 96–108 fL
- Mean Corpulscular Harmoglobin (MCH) = 17–31 pg
- Mean Corpulscular Harmoglobin Concentration (MCHC) = 32–36%
 
##### Classification of Anaemia - LEARN

### Q2.78
A 22-year-old woman with paroxysmal hypertension, tachycardia, diaphoresis, tachypnoea, flushing, cold and clammy skin, severe headache, angina and palpitation is diagnosed with a _phaeochromocytoma_. The *urine levels* of which of the following substances will be high in this patient?

	A. Dehydroepiandrosterone
	B. Pregnanetriol
	C. Cortisol
	D. Homovanillic acid
	E. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid
	
#### Answer: A. Dehydroepiandrosterone - *FALSE* = D. Homovanillic acid - TRUE
- Phaeochromocytoma is a tumour that arises in the adrenal medulla and secretes catecholamines. The principal urinary metabolic products of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) are the metanephrines, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA). Normal individuals excrete only very small amounts of these substances in the urine. Normal values for 24 h are as follows: free adrenaline and noradrenaline <100µg (<582nmol), total metanephrine <1.3mg (<7.1µmol), VMA <10mg (<50µmol) and HVA <15mg (<82.4µmol). In phaeochromocytoma and neuroblastoma, urinary excretion of adrenaline, noradrenaline and their metabolic products increases intermittently. However, excretion of these compounds may also be elevated in coma, dehydration or extreme stress states, in patients being treated with rauwolfia alkaloids, methyldopa or catecholamines, or after ingestion of foods containing large quantities of vanilla, especially if renal insufficiency is present. All of these compounds may be measured in the same urine specimen.
- Urinary dehydroepiandrosterone and pregnanetriol excretion is often increased in congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Free urinary cortisol levels are elevated in Cushing’s syndrome. Increased urinary excretion of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is seen in functioning carcinoids.

	B. MEN 1 is characterised by medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, phaeochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism
	C. MEN 2A is characterised by multiple mucosal neuroma, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and phaeochromocytoma, often associated with a marfanoid habitus
	D. MEN 2A is characterised by tumours of pancreatic islet cells and panhypopituitarism
	E. MEN 2B is characterised by tumours of the parathyroid glands, pancreatic islet cells and pituitary gland
	
#### Answer: A. MEN 1 is characterised by tumours of the parathyroid gland, pancreatic islet cells and pituitary gland - TRUE
- MEN Type 1 = pituitary gland + parathyroid gland + pancreatic islet cells (chromosome 11)= 3Ps

##### MEN Type I (*Wermer syndrome*): Chromosome 11 - LEARN
- MEN 1 is characterised by tumours of 
	1. Pituitary gland
	2. Parathyroid gland
	3. Pancreatic islet cells
- Gene causing MEN 1 has recently been identified on *chromosome 11* 
	- appears to function as a tumour-suppressor gene
- Clinical features of MEN 1 syndrome depend on pattern of tumour involvement in individual patient
- **NOTE** HyPERparathyroidism is present in >90% of affected patients
- Asymptomatic hypercalcaemia is the most common manifestation
	- 25% of patients have evidence of nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis
- In contrast to sporadic cases of hyperparathyroidism (solitary adenomas)
	- diffuse hyperplasia or multiple adenomas are found more frequently

##### MEN Type IIA (*Sipple syndrome*): Chromosome 10 - LEARN
- MEN 2A is characterised by 
	1. Medullary Carcinoma of Thyroid
	2. Phaeochromocytoma
	3. Parathyroid gland = HyPERparathyroidism
- Clinical features of MEN 2A depend on type of tumour present
- Almost all patients with MEN 2A syndrome have medullary carcinoma of thyroid
	- Phaeochromocytoma occurs in about 50% of patients within MEN 2A
- Hyperparathyroidism is less common than medullary carcinoma of thyroid or phaeochromocytoma
	- 25% of affected patients within MEN 2A have clinical evidence of hyperparathyroidism
	- with hypercalcaemia, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis or renal failure

##### MEN Type IIB (*Gorlin syndrome*): Chromosome 10 - LEARN
- Distinctive feature of MEN 2B syndrome is the presence of **mucosal neuromas** in most affected patients
	- Neuromas appear as small glistening bumps about lips, tongue and buccal mucosa
- Eyelids, conjunctivae and corneas are also commonly involved 
	Thickened eyelids and diffusely hypertrophied lips are characteristic
- Gastrointestinal abnormalities related to altered motility (constipation, diarrhoea and, occasionally, megacolon) are common and thought to result from diffuse intestinal ganglioneuromatosis.

### Q2.80
Calcium is required for the proper functioning of numerous intracellular and extracellular processes, including muscle contraction, nerve conduction, hormone release and blood coagulation. 

Which of the following conditions is associated with hyPOcalcaemia?

	A. Vitamin D excess - F
	B. Magnesium depletion
	C. Sarcoidosis
	D. Immobilisation
	E. Milk-alkali syndrome - F

#### Answer: D. Immobilisation - *FALSE* = B. Magnesium depletion - TRUE
- Hypocalcaemia is defined as a 
	- decrease in total plasma calcium concentration <8.8mg/dl (2.2mmol/L) 
	- in presence of normal plasma protein concentration
 
- Drugs associated with hypocalcaemia include those generally used to treat hypercalcaemia: anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital) and rifampin, which alter vitamin D metabolism; transfusion with blood products treated with citrate as well as radiocontrast agents containing the divalent ion-chelating agent EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetate).
- Magnesium depletion occurring with intestinal malabsorption or dietary deficiency can cause hypocalcaemia. Relative parathyroid hormone (PTH) deficiency and end-organ resistance to its action occur with magnesium depletion, resulting in plasma concentrations of <0.5mmol/L; repletion of magnesium improves PTH levels and renal Ca2+ conservation.
- Sarcoidosis, vitamin D excess, immobilisation and milk-alkali excess are associated with hyPERcalcaemia

##### Causes of HyPOcalcaemia - LEARN
- HyPOparathyroidism
- Vitamin D deficiency
- Renal tubular disease
- Renal failure
- **Magnesium depletion**
- Acute pancreatitis
- HyPOproteinaemia
- Enhanced bone formation with inadequate Ca2+ intake
- Septic shock
- HyPERphosphataemia

### Q2.81
Magnesium is the 4th most plentiful cation in the body. Which of the following statement about _magnesium metabolism_ is true?

	A. 70kg adult has roughly 200 mmol magnesium
	B. The extracellular fluid contains about 50% total body magnesium
	C. Normal plasma magnesium concentration ranges from 0.70 to 1.05 mmol/L (1.4 to 2.1 mEq/L)
	D. About 10% of plasma magnesium is ultrafiltered by the kidneys
	E. Magnesium is the key electrolyte for generation of a smooth muscle action potential
	
#### Answer: C. Normal plasma magnesium concentration ranges from 0.70 to 1.05 mmol/L (1.4 to 2.1 mEq/L) - TRUE
- Magnesium (Mg2+) is the fourth most plentiful cation in the body. A 70kg adult has roughly 1000mmol Mg2+. About 50% is sequestered in bone and not readily exchangeable with other compartments. The extracellular fluid (ECF) contains only about 1% of total body Mg2+. The remainder resides in the intracellular compartment. Normal plasma Mg2+ concentration ranges from 0.70 to 1.05mmol/L. The maintenance of plasma Mg2+ concentration is largely a function of dietary intake and extremely effective renal and intestinal conservation. Within 7 days of initiation of a Mg2+-deficient diet, renal and faecal Mg2+ excretion each fall to about 0.5mmol/24 h. About 70% of plasma Mg2+ is ultrafiltered by the kidney; the remainder is bound to protein. As with Ca2+, protein binding of Mg2+ is pH dependent. Plasma Mg2+ concentration and either total body Mg2+ or intracellular Mg2+ content are not closely related. However, severe plasma hypomagnesaemia may reflect diminished body stores of Mg2+. A wide variety of enzymes are Mg2+ activated or dependent. Mg2+ is required by all enzymatic processes involving ATP and is also required by many of the enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism. Mg2+ is required for thiamine pyrophosphate cofactor activity and appears to stabilise the structure of macromolecules such as DNA and RNA. Mg2+ is also related to calcium and potassium metabolism in an intimate but poorly understood way.

### Q2.82
The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is a subdivision of autonomic nervous system (ANS), and it operates in tandem with the other subdivision, sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Which of the following is an effect of stimulation of the PNS?

	A. Dilatation of the pupils
	B. Decreased secretion of the lacrimal glands
	C. Bronchodilatation
	D. Bradycardia
	E. Ejaculation
	
#### Answer: A. Dilatation of the pupils - *FALSE* = D. Bradycardia - TRUE
- Parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is one of two divisions of the autonomic nervous system
- Sometimes called the ‘rest and digest’ system, the parasympathetic system conserves energy as it
	- slows the heart rate
	- &uarr; intestinal and gland activity
	- relaxes sphincter muscles in gastrointestinal tract
- Although an oversimplification
	- **NOTE** PNS acts opposite to Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS; 'fight or flight')
	- in fact, in some tissues innervated by both systems, the effects are synergistic
- **NOTE** PNS only uses only acetylcholine (ACh) as its neurotransmitter
- ACh acts on two types of receptors
	1. Muscarinic 
	2. Nicotinic cholinergic receptors. 
- Most transmissions occur in two stages: when stimulated
	1. preganglionic nerve releases ACh at ganglion
		- acting on *nicotinic receptors* of postganglionic nerve
	2. postganglionic nerve then releases ACh
		- stimulates *muscarinic* receptors of target organ

##### Effects of Parasympathetic Stimulation ('rest & digest') - LEARN
- Pupil: constriction (greater depth of focal field)
- Ciliary muscle: constriction (near focus)
- Lacrimal gland: secretion increased
- Submandibular gland: secretion released and increased
- Parotid gland: secretion increased
- Heart: &darr; HR (**bradycardia**) and myocardial responsiveness
- Lung: constriction of air passages
- Gut: increased peristaltic and segmentation motility
- Liver: reduced blood glucose generation (from glycogen breakdown)
- Pancreas: insulin release
- Kidney: no innervation
- Urinary bladder: relaxation of sphincter and contraction of bladder wall musculature
- Penis: erection plus sensory facilitation (**Penis = PNS**)
- Arterioles in general: no innervation
- Arterioles in voluntary muscular system: no innervation
- Piloerector muscles (raise hair or goosebumps): no innervation
- Sweat glands: no innervation.


### Q2.83
After _cardiac survey_ a patient has a _very fast heart rate_ (HR). The ECG of this patient will show:

	A. A wider QRS complex
	B. A prolonged P–R interval
	C. A smaller QRS complex
	D. A longer ST segment
	E. A shortened Q–T interval

#### Answer: A. A wider QRS complex - *FALSE* = E. A shortened Q–T interval - TRUE
- &uarr; HR is associated with a shortened Q–T interval

##### Notes
- Q–T interval begins at onset of QRS complex and end of T wave, representing
	- Time between *start of ventricular depolarisation* and *end of ventricular repolarisation*
- It is useful as a measure of duration of repolarisation
- **NOTE** Q–T interval will vary depending-on *heart rate, age and gender*
	- It increases with bradycardia and decreases with tachycardia
	- Men have shorter Q–T intervals (0.39s) than women (0.41s)
- Q–T interval is influenced by electrolyte balance, drugs and ischaemia

### Q2.84
*Atrial fibrillation* (AF) occurs when the atria depolarise repeatedly and in an irregular uncontrolled manner, usually at an atrial rate greater than 350 bpm. No P waves are observed in the ECG as a result of the chaotic atrial depolarisation. 

Which of the following statements about P waves is true?

	A. The P-wave duration is normally <0.12 s
	B. The P-wave amplitude is normally >0.25 mV
	C. The P-wave contour is usually saw-toothed
	D. A negative P wave can indicate depolarisation arising from the bundle of His
	E. The P–R interval is the time (in seconds) from the beginning of the P wave to the end of the QRS complex

#### Answer: D. A negative P wave can indicate depolarisation arising from the bundle of His - *FALSE* = A. The P-wave duration is normally < 0.12s - TRUE
- P-wave duration is normally < 0.12 s and amplitude is normally <0.25 mV
	- Normal P–R interval duration range is from 0.12s to 0.20s

##### Notes
- P waves are caused by atrial depolarisation
	- In normal sinus rhythm (NSR) , SA node acts as pacemaker
- Electrical impulse from SA node spreads over right and left atria to cause *atrial depolarisation*
	- P-wave contour is usually smooth, entirely positive and of uniform size. 
- Atrial flutter waves (F waves) are larger than normal P waves - they have a saw-toothed waveform

#### 
- P-wave duration is normally < 0.12 s and the amplitude is normally <0.25 mV
	- Negative P wave = depolarisation arising from atrioventricular (AV) node
- P–R interval is time (in seconds) from 
	- beginning of P wave (onset of atrial depolarisation) to 
	- beginning of the QRS complex (onset of ventricular depolarisation). 
- Normal P–R interval duration range is from 0.12 s to 0.20 s
	- measured from initial deflection of P wave to initial deflection of QRS complex
- P–R interval is longer with high vagal tone
	- A prolonged P–R interval can correspond to impaired AV node conduction

### Q2.85
A 63-yo man with severe epigastric pain and raised troponin I levels has ECG changes that suggest an acute MU involving the _inferior wall of the heart_. Which of the following ECG leads will pick up these changes?

	A. V1–V3
	B. II, III, aVF
	C. RV4, RV5
	D. I, aVL, V4–V6
	E. V1–V6

#### Answer: B: II, III, aVF - TRUE
- About half of patients have diagnostic changes on their initial ECG. An ECG should be performed on any patient who is older than 45 years and experiencing atypical or new epigastric pain or nausea. In younger patients, an ECG should be considered when suggestive symptoms are present. Younger patients are disproportionately represented in missed cases. An ECG is a rapid, low-risk, relatively low-cost measure. Results indicating high probability of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are ST-segment elevation >1mm in two contiguous leads and new Q waves. Results indicating intermediate probability of AMI are ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion, Q waves and ST T-wave abnormalities that are known to be old. Results indicating low probability of AMI are normal findings on an ECG; however, normal or non-specific findings on an ECG do not exclude the possibility of AMI.
- Localisation of AMI, based on distribution of ECG abnormalities
	- Inferior wall: II, III, aVF
	- Lateral wall: I, aVL, V4–V6
	- Anteroseptal: V1–V3
	- Anterolateral: V1–V6
	- Right ventricular: RV4, RV5
	- Posterior wall: R/S ratio >1 in V1 and V2; T-wave changes (ie upright) in V1, V8 and V9.

### Q2.86
Potassium affects the way the cell membranes work and governs the action of the heart and the pathways between brain and muscles. Which of the following statements about _potassium metabolism_ is true? 

	A. 98% of potassium is extracellular - F
	B. Total body potassium stores are approximately 100mmol/kg (7000mmol in a 70kg person)
	C. The liver determines potassium homeostasis - F
	D. Early changes of hyPERkalaemia include inverted T waves and a prolonged Q–T interval - F
	E. Acidosis results in hyPERkalaemia
 
#### Answer: E. Acidosis results in hyPERkalaemia - TRUE
- Potassium (K+) is a major ion of the body. Almost 98% of K+ is intracellular, with the concentration gradient maintained by the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. The ratio of intracellular to extracellular K+ is important in determining the cellular membrane potential. Small changes in the extracellular K+ level can have profound effects on the function of the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems. The normal K+ level is 3.5–5.0mmol/L, and total body K+ stores are about 50mmol/kg (3500mmol in a 70kg person). Potassium homeostasis is maintained predominantly through the regulation of renal excretion. The most important site of regulation is the collecting duct, where aldosterone receptors are present. Hyperkalaemia is defined as a K+ level >5.5mmol/L. Ranges are as follows:
•    5.5–6.0mmol/L – mild condition
•    6.1–7.0mmol/L – moderate condition
•    >7.0mmol/L – severe condition
 
Hyperkalaemia results from the following:
•    Decreased or impaired K+ excretion: as observed with acute or chronic renal failure (most common), potassium-sparing diuretics, urinary obstruction, sickle cell disease, Addison’s disease and systemic lupus erythematosus (SlE).
•    Additions of K+ into extracellular space: as observed with potassium supplements (eg oral and intravenous potassium, salt substitutes), rhabdomyolysis and haemolysis (eg venepuncture, blood transfusions, burns, tumour lysis).
•    Transmembrane shifts (ie shifting potassium from the intracellular to extracellular space): as observed with acidosis and medication effects (eg acute digitalis toxicity, blockers, suxamethonium).
•    Fictitious or pseudohyperkalaemia: as observed with improper blood collection (eg ischaemic blood draw from venepuncture technique), laboratory error, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis.
 
An ECG is essential and may be instrumental in diagnosing hyperkalaemia in the appropriate clinical setting. ECG changes have a sequential progression of effects, which roughly correlate with the potassium level. ECG findings may be observed as follows: early changes of hyperkalaemia include peaked T waves, shortened Q–T interval and ST segment depression. These changes are followed by bundle-branch blocks causing a widening of the QRS complex, increases in the P–R interval and decreased amplitude of the P wave. These changes reverse with appropriate treatment. Without treatment, the P wave eventually disappears and the QRS morphology widens to resemble a sine wave. Ventricular fibrillation or asystole follows. ECG findings generally correlate with the potassium level, but potentially life-threatening arrhythmias can occur without warning at almost any level of hyperkalaemia.

### Q2.87
A *phospholipase* is an enzyme that converts *phospholipids into fatty acids* and other lipophilic substances. There are 4 major classes, termed A, B, c and D. Phospholipase c acts as a secondary messenger. 

Which of the following statements about _phospholipase c_ is true?
		
	A. It frees a fatty acid bound in an ester linkage to carbon-2 of glycerol
	B. Its activity is stimulated by hormone–receptor interactions coupled to a Gp protein
	C. It initiates a cascade, resulting in the activation of protein kinase A
	D. It initiates a cascade, resulting in the activation of guanylyl kinase
	E. It initiates a cascade, resulting in the activation of tyrosine kinase
	
#### Answer: E. It initiates a cascade, resulting in the activation of tyrosine kinase - *FALSE* = A. It frees a fatty acid bound in an ester linkage to carbon-2 of glycerol - TRUE
- Phospholipase C is activated by hormones with receptors that are coupled to a pG protein
	- This frees a fatty acid bound in an ester linkage to carbon-2 of glycerol

##### Notes
- It converts phosphatidyl inositol to inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) by cleaving the phosphoester bond between carbon-3 of glycerol and inositol-4,5-bisphosphate on phosphatidylinositol diphosphate
- IP3 and DAG can act on other proteins in cells to increase the activity of enzymes, eg protein kinase C, or on membrane channels such as calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in smooth muscle. 
- Phospholipase C does not directly stimulate reactions that affect activity of protein kinase A, tyrosine kinase or guanylyl cyclase
- Phospholipases A2 are a large family of enzymes that specifically deacylate fatty acids from the second carbon atom of the triglyceride backbone of phospholipids, producing a free fatty acid and a lysophospholipid.

### Q2.88
**Oedema** is defined as an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the tissues or cavities of the body. Oedema may be *mechanical* - the result of obstructed veins or heart failure (HF) - or caused by *increased permeability* of the capillary walls, as in liver or kidney disease or malnutrition. 

In the table below which of the physiological derangements will result in _pitting oedema_ and a _decrease in plasma osmolality_?

	| Gain/Loss	| Total body fluid	| Total body sodium	|
----|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
A	| LOSS		| Marked decrease 	| Decrease
B	| GAIN		| Marked increase	| Increase
C	| GAIN		| Increase			| Increase
D	| GAIN		| Increase			| Marked increase
E	| LOSS		| Decrease			| Marked decrease
	
#### Answer: NO CLUE = B | GAIN	| Marked increase | Increase - TRUE
- NOTE Pitting oedema is always associated with *retention of sodium*
	- Occurs when >3 litres of interstitial fluid collects
- As sodium is limited to ECF compartment,
	- excess total body sodium results in pitting oedema caused by
	- greater volume of interstitial space compared with vascular compartment
- To reduce plasma osmolality and produce pitting oedema = *greater gain in water than in sodium.*

### Q2.89
The total body sodium content is regulated by a balance between *dietary intake and renal excretion*. Which of the following statement about _sodium metabolism_ is true?

	A. Sodium concentration is highest in the intracellular fluid
	B. Active transport of sodium across all cells consumes most of the energy derived from cellular metabolism
	C. Sodium reabsorption across proximal tubular cells is mainly active and transcellular
	D. Sodium concentration gradient provides energy for the co-transport of H+
	E. Transport of sodium across the apical membrane of the nephron is an active transport process
	
#### Answer: E. Transport of sodium across the apical membrane of the nephron is an active transport process - *FALSE* = C. Sodium reabsorption across proximal tubular cells is mainly active and transcellular - TRUE
- Sodium is the major osmotically active cation in the ECF compartment
	- Most of the proximal reabsorption of Na+ occurs by active transport and is transcellular
- The transcellular pathway consists of the apical and basolateral membranes
	- The Na+/K+ ATPase pump in all cell membranes is responsible for active Na+ transport (efflux) and active K+ transport (influx)
- This enzyme maintains the low intracellular Na+ concentration and the high extracellular Na+ concentration
- **NOTE** Active transport consumes 30–50% of the energy derived from metabolism in most cells
- Although the influx of sodium from the tubular lumen to the proximal tubular cell is in the direction favoured by the electrochemical potential
	- this transport is mediated by specific membrane carrier proteins and not by simple diffusion. 
- These membrane proteins couple the active movement of other solutes to the passive movement of Na+
	- Examples include Na+-glucose and Na+-amino acid symporters and a Na+ antiporter
- In each case the potential energy released by downhill transport of Na+ is used to power the uphill transport of the other substance
- These transport systems are referred to as Na+-coupled, secondary, active transport processes
- It is important to remember that reabsorption includes 
	- not only Na+ influx from the tubular lumen 
	- but also active transport of Na+ out of the cell into the bloodstream

### Q2.90 - LEARN
The evaluation of the _jugular venous pulse_ (JVP) is an integral part of the physical examination because it reflects both the *mean right atrial pressure* and the *haemodynamic events in the right atrium*. Which of the following statement about the JVP waveform is true?

	A. The 'a' wave is caused by right ventricular contraction (a = atrium)
	B. The 'c' wave is the most prominent during inspiration
	C. The 'x' descent results from the increase in blood volume in the vena cava and the right atrium during ventricular systole when the tricuspid valve is closed
	D. The 'v' wave is a result of the downward displacement of the tricuspid valve during right ventricular systole - F (upward displacement) 
	E. The 'y' descent is caused by opening of the tricuspid valve

#### Answer: C. The 'x' descent results from the increase in blood volume in the vena cava and the right atrium during ventricular systole when the tricuspid valve is closed - *FALSE* = E. The 'y' descent is caused by opening of the tricuspid valve - TRUE
- The normal jugular venous pulse (JVP) reflects phasic pressure changes in the right atrium and consists of three positive waves and two negative troughs. The positive presystolic ‘a’ wave is produced by right atrial contraction and is the dominant wave in the JVP particularly during inspiration. During atrial relaxation, the venous pulse descends from the summit of the ‘a’ wave. Depending on the P–R interval, this descent may continue until a plateau (‘z’ point) is reached just before right ventricular systole. More often the descent is interrupted by a second positive venous or ‘c’ wave, which is produced by a bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium during right ventricular isovolumic systole and by the impact of the carotid artery adjacent to the jugular vein. Following the summit of the ‘c’ wave, the JVP contour declines, forming the normal negative systolic wave, the ‘x’ trough. The ‘x’ descent is a result of a combination of atrial relaxation, the downward displacement of the tricuspid valve during right ventricular systole and the ejection of blood from both the ventricles. The positive, late systolic ‘v’ wave in the JVP results from the increase in blood volume in the vena cavae and the right atrium during ventricular systole when the tricuspid valve is closed. After the peak of the ‘v’ wave is reached, the right atrial pressure decreases because of the diminished bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium and the decline in right ventricular pressure that follow tricuspid valve opening. The latter occurs at the peak of the ‘v’ wave in the JVP.
- Following the summit of the ‘v’ wave, there is a negative descending limb, referred to as the ‘y’ descent or diastolic collapse, which is caused by the opening of the tricuspid valve and flow of blood into the right ventricle. The initial ‘y’ descent corresponds to the right ventricular rapid filling phase. The trough of the ‘y’ wave occurs in early diastole and is followed by the ascending limb of the ‘y’ wave, which is produced by continued diastolic inflow of blood into the right side of the heart. The velocity of this ascending pressure curve depends on the rate of venous return and the distensibility of the chambers of the right side of the heart. When diastole is long, the descending limb of the ‘y’ wave is often followed by a small, brief, positive wave, the ‘h’ wave, which occurs just before the next ‘a’ wave. At times, there is a plateau phase rather than a distinct ‘h’ wave. With increasing pulse rate the ‘y’ trough and the ‘y’ ascent are followed immediately by the next ‘a’ wave. Usually, there are three visible major positive waves (‘a’, ‘c’, ‘v’) and two negative troughs (‘x’, ‘y’) when the pulse rate is below 90 beats/min and the P–R interval is normal. With faster heart rates there is often fusion of some of the pulse waves and an accurate analysis of the waveform is more difficult.

### Q2.91 - LEARN
In the normal JVP waveform there are 3 positive waves and 2 negative troughs. Which of the following statements about _abnormalities of these waves and troughs_ is true?

	A. The 'a' wave in the JVP is absent in sinus bradycardia
	B. Cannon 'a' waves are seen in tricuspid regurgitation
	C. The 'cv' wave is a feature of tricuspid stenosis
	D. The 'v' wave is equal to the ‘a’ wave in patients with an atrial septal defect
	E. A sharp 'y' descent is a feature of left-sided heart failure

#### Answer: B. Cannon 'a' waves are seen in tricuspid regurgitation - *FALSE* = D. The 'v' wave is equal to the ‘a’ wave in patients with an atrial septal defect - TRUE
- The ‘a’ wave in the JVP is absent when there is no effective atrial contraction, such as in atrial fibrillation. In certain other conditions, the ‘a’ wave may not be apparent. In sinus tachycardia the ‘a’ wave may fuse with the preceding ‘v’ wave, particularly if the P–R interval is prolonged. In some patients with sinus tachycardia, the ‘a’ wave may occur during the ‘v’ wave or ‘y’ descent and may be small or absent. In the presence of first-degree heart block, a discrete ‘a’ wave with ascending and descending limbs is often completed before the first heart sound and the ‘ac’ interval is prolonged. Large ‘a’ waves are of considerable diagnostic value. When giant ‘a’ waves are present with each beat, the right atrium is contracting against an increased resistance. This may result from obstruction at the tricuspid valve (tricuspid stenosis or atresia, right atrial myxoma or conditions associated with increased resistance to right ventricular filling). A giant ‘a’ wave is more likely to occur in patients with pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary hypertension in whom both the atrial and the right ventricular septa are intact.
- Cannon ‘a’ waves occur when the right atrium contracts while the tricuspid valve is closed during right ventricular systole. Cannon waves may occur either regularly or irregularly and are most common in the presence of arrhythmias. The most important alteration of the normally negative systolic collapse (‘x’ wave) of the JVP is its obliteration or even replacement by a positive wave. This is usually the result of tricuspid regurgitation. In some patients with moderate tricuspid regurgitation, there is a fairly distinct positive wave during the ventricular systole between the ‘c’ and ‘v’ waves. This abnormal systolic waveform is usually referred to as a ‘v’ or ‘cv’ wave, although it has also been referred to as an ‘r’ (regurgitant) or ‘s’ (systolic) wave. Normally the ‘v’ wave is lower in amplitude than the ‘a’ wave in the JVP. In patients with an atrial septal defect, however, the higher left atrial pressure is transmitted to the right atrium, and the ‘a’ and ‘v’ waves are often equal in the right atrium and the JVP. In patients with constrictive pericarditis and sinus rhythm, the right atrial ‘a’ and ‘v’ waves may also be equal, but the venous pressure is increased, which is unusual with isolated atrial septal defect. In patients with constrictive pericarditis who are in atrial fibrillation, the ‘cv’ wave is prominent and the ‘y’ descent rapid. A venous pulse characterised by a sharp ‘y’ trough and a rapid ascent to the baseline is seen in patients with constrictive pericarditis or severe right-sided heart failure.

### Q2.92 - LEARN
*Ketoacidosis* is a type of metabolic acidosis that is caused by high concentrations of keto acids, formed by the *deamination of amino acids*. Which of the following conditions is _associated with ketoacidosis_?

	A. Expanded blood volume - F
	B. Increased lipid synthesis - F
	C. Positive nitrogen balance
	D. Type 2 diabetes - F
	E. Low plasma c-peptide levels
	
#### Answer: C. Positive nitrogen balance - *FALSE* = E. Low plasma c-peptide levels - TRUE
- Ketoacidosis is most commonly associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) = state of absolute or relative insulin deficiency aggravated by 
	1. Ensuing hyPERglycaemia
	2. Dehydration
	3. Acidosis-producing derangements in intermediary metabolism
- Most common causes are 
	1. Underlying infection
	2. Disruption of insulin treatment
	3. New onset of diabetes
- DKA is typically characterised by 
	1. HyPERglycaemia >300 mg/dl
	2. Low bicarbonate (<15 mmol/L)
	3. Acidosis (pH <7.30) 
	4. Ketonaemia and ketonuria
- Patient with untreated type 1 diabetes mellitus has 
	- *low levels of plasma insulin and C peptide* caused by β-cell destruction
- Absence of insulin, the primary anabolic hormone, means that 
	- tissues such as muscle, fat and liver *do not take up glucose*

**Notes**
- Counterregulatory hormones, such as glucagon, growth hormone and catecholamines, enhance triglyceride breakdown into free fatty acids and gluconeogenesis, which is the main cause for the elevation in serum glucose in DKA
- β Oxidation of these free fatty acids leads to increased formation of ketone bodies
- Overall, metabolism in DKA shifts from the normal fed state characterised by carbohydrate metabolism to a fasting state characterised by fat metabolism
- Secondary consequences of the primary metabolic derangements in DKA include an ensuing metabolic acidosis as the ketone bodies produced by β oxidation of free fatty acids deplete extracellular and cellular acid buffers
- The hyperglycaemia-induced osmotic diuresis depletes sodium, potassium, phosphates and water, as well as ketones and glucose
- Commonly, the total body water deficit is 10% and the potassium deficit is 5mmol/kg body weight
- The total body potassium deficit may be masked by the acidosis, which sustains an increased serum potassium level
- The potassium level can drop precipitously once rehydration and insulin treatment start
- Urinary loss of ketoanions with brisk diuresis and intact renal function may also lead to a component of hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis

### Q2.93
*Vasoconstrictors* are used clinically to increase BP or to reduce local blood flow. Which of the following _naturally occurring peptides produces intense vasoconstriction_?

	A. Neurotensin
	B. Atrial natriuretic peptide
	C. Endothelin
	D. Bradykinin
	E. Substance P

#### Answer: B. Atrial natriuretic peptide - *FALSE* = C. Endothelin - TRUE
- Endothelin (ET-1), synthesised by vascular endothelium, is one of the most powerful vasoconstrictor substances known
- Vascular smooth muscle contraction is observed at concentrations as low as 10–11 mol
- An endothelin precursor (big ET-1 or pro-ET-1; 39 amino acids) is cleaved to ET-1 (21 amino acids) by an endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) found on the endothelial cell membrane
- ET-1 can then bind to ETA receptors found on adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to calcium mobilisation and smooth muscle contraction
- The ETA receptor is coupled to a G-protein linked to phospholipase C and the formation of IP3
- There are also ETB receptors located on the vascular smooth muscle, which also produce contraction
- ET-1 release is stimulated by angiotensin II, ADH, thrombin, cytokines, reactive oxygen species and shearing forces acting on the vascular endothelium
- ET-1 release is inhibited by prostacyclin and atrial natriuretic peptide as well as by nitric oxide
- ET-1 has a number of other actions besides vasoconstriction
- ET-1 stimulates aldosterone secretion, produces 
	- positive inotropy and chronotropy in the heart
	- decreases renal blood flow and GFR, and 
	- releases atrial natriuretic peptide
- **NOTE** ET-1 has been implicated in pathogenesis of 
	1. Hypertension
	2. Vasospasm
	3. Heart failure

### Q2.94
A patient has an *immunological tubulointerstitial* disease process that has _destroyed the juxtaglomerular apparatus_ in his kidneys. Which of the following abnormalities will be seen in this patient?

	A. HyPERaldosteronism
	B. HyPERkalaemia
	C. Increase in angiotensin II
	D. Metabolic alkalosis - F
	E. Loss of H+ in the urine

#### Answer: A. HyPERaldosteronism - *FALSE* = B. HyPERkalaemia - TRUE
- Destruction of JGA results in &darr; renin production
	- which causes &darr; angiotensin II and aldosterone levels
- HyPOaldosteronism leads to
	1. inability to reabsorb sodium in late distal and early collecting ducts (*hyPOnatraemia*)
	2. inability to excrete potassium (hyPERkalaemia)
	3. inability to excrete H+ (*metabolic acidosis*) in exchange for sodium

**Notes**
- The juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) is a small endocrine organ associated with individual nephrons within kidneys
- It is composed of:
	- macula densa of the proximal distal tubule of nephron
	- closely situated afferent arteriole of the same nephron. 

- Two cell types intervene between macula densa and arteriole in ‘mesangial’ region
	1. Granular mesangial cells containing prorenin granules, the precursor of renin
		- they are modified smooth muscle cells that secrete renin into the afferent arteriole
	2. Agranular lacis cells
- Sympathetic nerves lie in close proximity to the granular cells.

- JGA is in an ideal position to monitor
	- amount and composition of urine in the nephron
	- blood in the afferent arteriole
- Renin secretion may be modified accordingly

### Q2.95
After coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) a 56-yo man develops atelectasis of both lung bases. The physiotherapist advises him that deep inspiration following by gradual expiration will be good for him. Which of the following events _takes place during deep inspiration_?

	A. The pressure gradient between the peripheral veins and the right atrium decreases
	B. Pulmonary blood volume decreases
	C. Cardiac output of the right ventricle increases
	D. Cardiac output of the left ventricle increases
	E. Venous return to the left atrium increases
	
#### Answer: E. Venous return to the left atrium increases - *FALSE* = C. Cardiac output of the right ventricle increases - TRUE
- **NOTE** RILE = RIGHT Inspiration, LEFT Expiration

**Notes**
- Central venous pressure decreases with deep inspiration, thereby increasing venous return
- This is explained by the negative intrathoracic pressure originated at inspiration, which is transmitted to the great veins of the thorax 
	- moreover, the downward diaphragm movement during this phase helps the pulling of blood towards the heart by increasing the intra-abdominal pressure
- At expiration, the mechanisms reverse
- The end-diastolic volume and stroke volume of the right heart increase
- The increased output of the right heart enters a pulmonary circulation in which capacitance has been increased by the decreased intrathoracic pressure
- Therefore, venous return to the left atrium does not increase until expiration, at which time the intrapleural pressure becomes less negative
- Cardiac output from the left ventricle increases during expiration

### Q2.96
A patient with *low systemic vascular resistance* after surgery is started on an infusion of a vasoconstrictor agent. Which of the following effects is likely to be _produced by the vasoconstrictor agent_ in this patient?

	A. Increased end-diastolic volume
	B. Decreased preload
	C. Decreased stroke volume
	D. Increased end-diastolic reserve volume
	E. Decreased work of the heart
	
#### Answer: E. Decreased work of the heart - *FALSE* = A. Increased end-diastolic volume - TRUE
- Vasoconstrictor agents such as noradrenaline or ephedrine act primarily 
	- on small veins to increase peripheral venous pressure
- This results in 
	1. &uarr; venous return
	2. &uarr; preload, and therefore 
	3. &uarr; ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV)
- An increase in ventricular EDV results in an increased stroke volume, because the ventricle responds to stretch by developing a greater force of contraction ejecting a greater volume
- An increase in EDV leads to a decrease in the enddiastolic reserve volume
- The sum of all these effects is increased cardiac workload

### Q2.97
*Motor neurons* regulate the sensitivity of the muscle spindle to muscle stretching. With activation of neurons, intrafusal muscle fibres contract so that only a small stretch is required to activate spindle sensory neurons and the stretch reflex. 

Which of the following statements about the _motor neurons_ is correct?

	A. They are inhibited by Golgi tendon organs
	B. They are inhibited by descending motor tracts
	C. They are stimulated by 1a afferents
	D. They are inhibited by 1a afferents
	E. They are located in the posterior horn of the spinal cord
	
#### Answer: E. They are located in the posterior horn of the spinal cord - *FALSE* = B. They are inhibited by descending motor tracts - TRUE
- γ motor neurons are located in anterior grey horn of spinal cord and motor nuclei of cranial nerves
	- Stimulating contraction of intrafusal fibres in muscle spindles to regulate their activity
- **NOTE** γ motor neurons are controlled primarily by neurons in *descending motor tracts* from brain
- Most of these neurons are inhibitory, although some are excitatory
- Afferents from muscle spindles (1a afferents) and the Golgi tendon organs do not synapse with γ motor neurons

### Q2.98
The *transmembrane voltage changes* that take place during an action potential result from changes in the permeability of the membrane to specific ions; the internal and external concentrations of these are maintained in an imbalance by the cells. Minimally, an action potential involves a depolarisation, a repolarisation and finally a hyper-polarisation. The _repolarisation phase of an action potential_ is a result of:

	A. Increasing activity of the Na+/K+ pump
	B. Increasing Na+ permeability and increasing K+ permeability
	C. Increasing Na+ permeability and decreasing K+ permeability
	D. Decreasing Na+ permeability and rapidly increasing K+ permeability
	E. Decreasing Na+ permeability and a delayed increasing K+ permeability
	
#### Answer: C. Increasing Na+ permeability and decreasing K+ permeability - *FALSE* = E. Decreasing Na+ permeability and a delayed increasing K+ permeability - TRUE
- The transmembrane voltage changes that take place during an action potential result from changes in the permeability of the membrane to specific ions, the internal and external concentrations of which are maintained in an imbalance by cells 
- In the axon fibres of nerves, depolarisation results from the inward rush of Na+, whereas repolarisation and hyperpolarisation arise from an outward movement of K+
- Ca2+ ions make up most or all of the depolarising currents at an axon’s presynaptic terminus, in muscle cells (including those of the heart) and in some dendrites
- The imbalance of ions that makes possible not only action potentials but the resting cell potential arises through the work of the pumps, in particular the Na+/K+ exchanger
- While the cell is at resting cell potential, the electric forces between the Na+ and K+ of the neuron is counterbalanced by the diffusive forces, creating a state of equilibrium.
- Changes in membrane permeability and the onset and cessation of ionic currents reflect the opening and closing of voltage-gated ion channels, which provide portals through the membrane for ions
- Residing in and spanning the membrane, these proteins sense and respond to changes in transmembrane potential
- The depolarisation phase of an action potential is the result of the opening of voltage-gated ion channels, either sodium or calcium channels or a combination of both, depending on the particular membrane
- As Na+ and Ca2+ are positively charged, when a voltage-gated Na+ channel or Ca2+ channel opens, these positively charged ions move into the cell
- Voltage-gated Na+ channels automatically gate shut after about a millisecond. Ca2+-mediated action potentials can be much longer in duration
- The repolarisation phase of an action potential is the result of the opening of voltage-gated K+ channels
- There is a decrease in Na+ permeability (inactivation of the voltage-gated Na+ channels) and a delayed increase in K+ permeability during the repolarisation phase of the action potential
- Cells normally keep the concentration of K+ high inside cells
- When voltage-gated K+ channels open, positively charged K+ move out of the cell, causing the membrane potential to return to a negative inside potential
- The Na+/K+ pump plays no direct role in the action potential

### Q2.99
Calcium is the so-called 'trigger' for muscle contraction, In the _skeletal muscle calcium initiates contraction_ by:

	A. Being released from the sarcolemma during an action potential
	B. Binding to tropomyosin
	C. Binding to troponin
	D. Covering actin-binding sites
	E. Binding to myosin cross-bridges

#### Answer: E. Binding to myosin cross-bridges - *FALSE* = C. Binding to troponin - TRUE
- **NOTE** Calcium is the so-called 'trigger' for muscle contraction
- Calcium aids in the formation of action potential in the motor end-plate, and is later released from the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (not the sarcolemma) into the cytosol of a striated (cardiac and skeletal) muscle cells
- **Next Ca2+ binds to troponin**
	- Causes a change in conformation of *troponin-tropomyosin complex*
	- Exposing myosin-binding sites on actin filament
- Myosin heads then attach to actin filament and muscle contraction occurs

### Q2.100
The *human retina* has on-centre cells and off-centre cells that are distinguished by the way in which they respond to light on the centres of their respective fields. In response to light on the retina, the *major difference between on-centre cells and off-centre cells* is:

	A. Bipolar cells in on centres depolarise and the bipolar cells in off centres hyperpolarise in response to light
	B. Bipolar cells in on centres hyperpolarise and the bipolar cells in off centres depolarise in response to light
	C. Ganglion cells in on centres hyperpolarise and the ganglion cells in off centres depolarise in response to light
	D. Rods stimulate on centres whereas cones stimulate off centres
	E. Rods stimulate off centres whereas cones stimulate on centres

#### Answer: D. Rods stimulate on centres whereas cones stimulate off centres - *FALSE* = A. Bipolar cells in on centres depolarise and the bipolar cells in off centres hyperpolarise in response to light - TRUE
- Each of the neurons in the various layers of the retina covers an area in your field of vision
- This area in space, where the presence of an appropriate stimulus will modify the activity of this neuron, is called the receptive field of this neuron
- The receptive field of a single photoreceptor cell, for example, can be said to be limited to the tiny spot of light, within your field of vision, that corresponds to this photoreceptor’s precise location on your retina
- But, in each succeeding layer of the retina, the receptive fields become increasingly complex, and they become even more complex when it comes to the neurons of the visual cortex
- An example of this complexity is the receptive fields of bipolar cells, which are circular
- But the centre and the surrounding area of each circle work in opposite ways: a ray of light that strikes the centre of the field has the opposite effect from one that strikes the area surrounding it (known as the ‘surround’)
- In fact, there are two types of bipolar cells, distinguished by the way they respond to light on the centres of their receptive fields
- They are called oncentre and off-centre cells
- If a *light stimulus* applied to the centre of a bipolar cell’s receptive field has an *excitatory effect* on that cell, causing it to become **depolarised**, it is an **on-centre** cell. 
- The other kind of bipolar cells, **off-centre** cells, display exactly the reverse behaviour: light on the field’s centre has an inhibitory (**hyperpolarising**) effect, whereas light on the surround has an excitatory (depolarising) effect.

30% - F: 102, 104, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110

### Q2.101
A 75-year-old woman who has difficulty understanding conversation, particularly when background noise is present, and complains that others mumble is diagnosed as _presbycusis_. 

Which of the following is the most likely to occur in this disorder?

	A. Nystagmus	
	B. Loss of sensitivity to angular acceleration
	C. Loss of sensitivity to linear acceleration
	D. Loss of sensitivity to high-frequency sounds
	E. Loss of sensitivity to low-frequency sounds
	    
#### Answer: D. Loss of sensitivity to high-frequency sounds - TRUE
- Presbycusis is defined as sensorineural hearing loss that occurs in people as they age and that may be affected by genetic or acquired factors. Presbycusis begins after age 20 but is usually significant only in those aged over 65. Men are affected more often and more severely than women. Stiffening of the basilar membrane and deterioration of the hair cells, stria vascularis, ganglion cells and cochlear nuclei may play a role in pathogenesis, and presbycusis appears to be related in part to noise exposure. It first affects the highest frequencies (18– 20kHz) and gradually affects the lower frequencies; it usually begins to affect the 4 to 8kHz range by age 55–65, although variation is considerable. Some persons are severely handicapped by age 60, and some are essentially untouched at age 90. The loss of high-frequency hearing makes discrimination of speech particularly difficult. Thus, many people who have this type of loss have difficulty understanding conversation, particularly when background noise is present, and complain that others mumble.

### Q2.102
Skeletal muscle fibres can be divided into two basic types
- Type I: slow-twitch fibres
- Type II: fast-twitch fibres

Which of the following statements best distinguishes type II from type I muscle fibres?

	A. Type II muscle fibres are rich in mitochondria
	B. Type II muscle fibres are rich in glycogen
	C. Type II muscle fibres function best in aerobic exercise conditions
	D. Type II muscle fibres are the dominant fibres in the postural muscles - F
	E. Type II fibres do not hypertrophy with exercise - F

#### Answer: C. Type II muscle fibres function best in aerobic exercise conditions - *FALSE* = B. Type II muscle fibres are rich in glycogen - TRUE
- A muscle fibre is a single cell of a muscle
	- Muscle fibres contain many myofibrils, the contractile unit of muscles
	- Muscle fibres are very long; a single fibre can reach a length of 30cm
- Skeletal muscle fibres can be divided into two basic types
	1. type I (slow-twitch)
	2. type II (fast-twitch) fibres

##### Type I (slow-twitch, oxidative) - LEARN
- Primarily *cellular respiration* and, as a result, have relatively high endurance
- To support their *high-oxidative metabolism*, these muscle fibres typically have lots of *mitochondria and myoglobin*, and thus appear red or what is typically termed *'dark' meat* in poultry
- Type I muscle fibres are typically found in high endurance muscles such as postural muscles
- They are capable of long, sustained contractions without fatigue, and contain scant glycogen
- *Size remains unchanged with exercise* but conditioning increases enzymes in aerobic glycolysis
	- They appear pale even with ATPase staining at an alkaline pH

##### Type II (fast-twitch, anaerobic) - LEARN
- Primarily *anaerobic metabolism* and have relatively low endurance
- As a result of their low-oxidative demand, these muscle fibres have low levels of mitochondria and myoglobin, and thus appear white
- These muscle fibres are typically used during tasks requiring short bursts of strength, such as sprints or weightlifting
- Type II muscle fibres cannot sustain contractions for a significant length of time, and are typically found in the *white muscle* such as the biceps
	- **They are rich in glycogen**. 
- More enzymes for anaerobic glycolysis than type I fibres, 
	- They hypPERtrophy with regular training
- They appear dark with ATPase staining at an alkaline pH

### Q2.103
A 65-year-old man developed spasticity secondary to an upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion caused by a stroke. Which of he following is most likely to be found in the muscles of this patient?

	A. Increased muscle tone
	B. Atrophy
	C. Paraesthesia
	D. Fasciculations
	E. Less active stretch reflexes

#### Answer: A. Increased muscle tone - TRUE
- Primitive reflexes include the grasp, suck and snout reflexes
- Damage to UMN reduces considerable inhibitory influence that these tracts have on lower motor neurons
	- Excitatory influence of reflexes predominates, causing an increase in muscle tone and hyperreflexia. 

- Fasciculations are fine movements of the muscle under the skin and are indicative of lower motor neuron disease
- Caused by denervation of whole motor units leading to *ACh hypersensitivity* at denervated muscle
	- Atrophy of affected muscle is usually concurrent with fasciculations

- **NOTE** Paraesthesia (*abnormal sensations*) is not a feature of motor neuron lesions

##### Upper Motor Neuron Lesions (&darr; inhibition)- LEARN
1. Weakness
2. Spasticity
3. HyPERtonia - &uarr; muscle tone
4. HypPERreflexia - &uarr; primitive reflexes
5. Babinski’s sign

##### Lower Motor Neuron Lesions (full deinnervation) - LEARN
1. Weakness
4. Atrophy
3. HyPOtonia
4. HyPOreflexia

### Q2.104
A marathon runner was disqualified from the Athens olympics because be was found to have *used erthropoietin* to enhance endurance, Which of the following features is a marker of _erythpoietin-stimulated bone marrow_?

	A. Low reticulocyte count
	B. Decreased radioactive plasma iron turnover
	C. Decreased serum ferritin
	D. Increased myeloid:erythroid ratio
	E. Shift cells in the peripheral blood film

#### Answer: C. Decreased serum ferritin - *FALSE* = E. Shift cells in the peripheral blood film - TRUE
- Shift cells are not normally found in the peripheral blood unless the bone marrow is stimulated by EPO or something in the marrow is pushing cells out, such as a metastatic tumour. 

**Notes**
- Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone that is a growth factor for erythrocyte (RBC) precursors in the bone marrow. It increases the number of RBCs in the blood. In adult humans, EPO is produced primarily by peritubular cells in the kidneys, where its production is stimulated by low oxygen levels in the blood. Some EPO is also produced by the liver, which is the primary source in the fetus. EPO acts by binding to a specific erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) on the surface of red cell precursors in the bone marrow, stimulating them to transform into mature RBCs. As a result the oxygen level in blood reaching the kidney rises and the amount of EPO produced decreases. Synthetic erythropoietin is available as a therapeutic agent produced by recombinant DNA technology. It is used in treating anaemia resulting from either chronic renal failure or chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer. Its use is also believed to be common as a blood-doping agent in endurance sports such as bicycle racing, triathlon and marathon running.

- Shift cells are not normally found in the peripheral blood unless the bone marrow is stimulated by EPO or something in the marrow is pushing cells out, such as a metastatic tumour. 
- These cells have a bluish discoloration (polychromasia) on the Wright–Giemsa stain because they have more RNA than a peripheral blood reticulocyte
- Shift cells are basophilic staining RBCs that are even younger than peripheral blood reticulocytes
- These cells are considered to be marrow reticulocytes as opposed to peripheral blood reticulocytes
- The reticulocyte count is the best index of erythropoiesis, or how well the bone marrow is responding to an anaemia
- The reticulocyte count is increased in an erythropoietin-stimulated bone marrow
	- The normal myeloid:erythroid ratio is 3:1
	- &uarr; RBCs in response to EPO will *decrease ratio*
- Decreased serum ferritin indicates a decrease in the marrow iron stores, as in iron deficiency
- It does not evaluate effective or ineffective erythropoiesis
- The radioactive plasma iron turnover will increase in EPO-stimulated bone marrow as radioactively labelled iron will be removed from plasma and delivered to developing normoblasts in the marrow

### Q2.105 - LEARN
The blooding system of coagulation pathway, similar to the complement system, is a proteolytic cascade. Which of he following statements about _coagulation pathway_ is true?

	A. The Hagemann factor (factor XII), factor XI, prekallikrein and high-molecular-weight kininogen are involved in the extrinsic pathway of coagulation
	B. The intrinsic pathway provides a very rapid response to tissue injury, generating activated factor X almost instantaneously
	C. The intrinsic and extrinsic systems converge at factor X to a single common pathway, which is ultimately responsible for the production of thrombin (factor IIa)
	D. The end result of the clotting pathway is the production of fibrin for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin
	E. The coagulation pathway acts independently of other plasma enzyme systems
	    
#### Answer: C. The intrinsic and extrinsic systems converge at factor X to a single common pathway, which is ultimately responsible for the production of thrombin (factor IIa) - TRUE
- The blood clotting system or coagulation pathway, similar to the complement system, is a proteolytic cascade. Each enzyme of the pathway is present in the plasma as a zymogen, ie an inactive form, which on activation undergoes proteolytic cleavage to release the active factor from the precursor molecule. The coagulation pathway functions as a series of positive and negative feedback loops that control the activation process. The ultimate goal of the pathway is to produce thrombin, which can then convert soluble fibrinogen into fibrin, forming a clot. The generation of thrombin can be divided into three phases: the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways that provide alternative routes for the generation of factor X, and the final common pathway that results in thrombin formation.
- The intrinsic pathway is activated when blood comes into contact with either subendothelial connective tissues or a negatively charged surface that is exposed as a result of tissue damage. Quantitatively, it is the most important of the two pathways, but is slower to cleave fibrin than the extrinsic pathway. The Hageman factor (factor XII), factor XI, prekallikrein and high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) are involved in this pathway of activation. Thus, this pathway provides a further example of the interrelationship of the various enzyme cascade systems in plasma.
- The first step is the binding of Hageman factor to a subendothelial surface exposed by an injury. A complex of prekallikrein and HMWK interacts with the exposed surface in close proximity to the bound factor XII, which becomes activated. During activation, the single-chain protein of the native Hageman factor is cleaved into two chains (50 and 28kDa), which remain linked by a disulphide bond. The light chain (28kDa) contains the active site and the molecule is referred to as activated Hageman factor (factor XIIa). There is evidence that the Hageman factor can autoactivate, so the pathway is self-amplifying once triggered (compare with the alternative pathway of complement). Activated Hageman factor in turn activates prekallikrein. The kallikrein produced can then cleave factor XII and a further amplification mechanism is triggered. The activated factor XII remains in close contact with the activating surface, such that it can activate factor XI, the next step in the intrinsic pathway that, to proceed efficiently, requires calcium.
- Also involved at this stage is HMWK, which binds to factor XI and facilitates the activation process. Activated factors XIa, XIIa and kallikrein are all serine proteases, as are many of the enzymes of the complement system. Eventually the intrinsic pathway activates factor X, a process that can also be brought about by the extrinsic pathway. Factor X is the first molecule of the common pathway and is activated by a complex of molecules containing activated factor IX, factor VIII, calcium and phospholipid, which is provided by the platelet surface, where this reaction usually takes place. The precise role of factor VIII in this reaction is not clearly understood. Its presence in the complex is obviously essential, as evidenced by the serious consequences of factor VIII deficiency experienced by people with haemophilia. Factor VIII is modified by thrombin, via a reaction that results in greatly enhanced factor VIII activity and promotes the activation of factor X.
- The extrinsic pathway is an alternative route for the activation of the clotting cascade. It provides a very rapid response to tissue injury, generating activated factor X almost instantaneously, compared with the seconds or even minutes required for the intrinsic pathway to activate factor X. The main function of the extrinsic pathway is to augment the activity of the intrinsic pathway.
- There are two components unique to the extrinsic pathway: tissue factor or factor III, and factor VII. Tissue factor is present in most human cells bound to the cell membrane. The activation process for tissue factor is not entirely clear. Once activated, it binds rapidly to factor VII, which is then activated to form a complex of tissue factor, activated factor VII, calcium and a phospholipid; this complex then rapidly activates factor X.
- The intrinsic and extrinsic systems converge at factor X to a single common pathway, which is ultimately responsible for the production of thrombin (factor IIa). The end-result of the clotting pathway is the production of thrombin for the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Fibrinogen is a dimer soluble in plasma. Exposure of fibrinogen to thrombin results in its rapid proteolysis and the release of fibrinopeptide A. The loss of small peptide A is not sufficient to render the resulting fibrin molecule insoluble, a process that is needed for clot formation, but it tends to form complexes with adjacent fibrin and fibrinogen molecules. A second peptide, fibrinopeptide B, is cleaved by thrombin, and the fibrin monomers formed by this second proteolytic cleavage polymerise spontaneously to form an insoluble gel. The polymerised fibrin, held together by non-covalent and electrostatic forces, is stabilised by the transamidating enzyme factor XIIIa, produced by the action of thrombin on factor XIII. These insoluble fibrin aggregates (clots), together with aggregated platelets (thrombi), block the damaged blood vessel and prevent further bleeding.
- The coagulation pathway and other plasma enzyme systems are interrelated. Contact activation of the coagulation pathway, in addition to promoting blood clotting, results in the generation of plasminogen activator activity, which is involved in fibrinolysis or clot removal. Activated Hageman factor and its peptides can also initiate the formation of kallikrein from plasma prekallikrein, and this triggers the release of bradykinin from kininogens in the plasma. Kinins are responsible for dilating small blood vessels, inducing a fall in blood pressure, triggering smooth muscle contraction and increasing the permeability of vessel walls. In addition, activation of the coagulation pathway produces a vascular permeability factor, as well as chemotactic peptides for professional phagocytes.

### Q2.106
A 45-yo woman has an _infarct affecting her cerebellum_. Which of the following movement defects is she most likely to develop?

	A. Chorea
	B. Athetosis
	C. Resting tremor
	D. Intention tremor
	E. Tics

#### Answer: A. Chorea - *FALSE* = D. Intention tremor - TRUE
- Disorders of the cerebellum and its inflow or outflow pathways produce deficits in the rate, range and force of movement. Anatomically, the cerebellum has three subdivisions. The archicerebellum (vestibulocerebellum), comprising the flocculonodular lobe, helps maintain equilibrium and coordinate eye–head–neck movements, and is closely interconnected with the vestibular nuclei. The midline vermis (paleocerebellum) helps coordinate movement of the trunk and legs; vermis lesions result in abnormalities of stance and gait. The lateral hemispheres, which make up the neocerebellum, control ballistic and finely coordinated limb movements, predominantly of the arms. 
 
- Chorea is brief, purposeless involuntary movements of the distal extremities and face, which may merge imperceptibly into purposeful or semi-purposeful acts that mask the involuntary motion. Athetosis is writhing movements, often with alternating postures of the proximal limbs that blend continuously into a flowing stream of movement. Chorea and athetosis often occur together (choreoathetosis). The most important cause of chorea is Huntington’s disease. Other causes include thyrotoxicosis, SLE affecting the central nervous system (CNS) and drugs (eg antipsychotics). Chorea and athetosis are manifestations of dopaminergic overactivity in the basal ganglia – the antithesis of Parkinson’s disease. Resting tremor is a feature of parkinsonism. Tics are brief, rapid, simple or complex involuntary movements that are stereotypical and repetitive, but not rhythmic. Simple tics (eg blinking) often begin as nervous mannerisms in childhood or later and disappear spontaneously. Complex tics often resemble fragments of normal behaviour.

##### Signs of Cerebellar Disease - LEARN
- Ataxia: reeling, wide-based gait.
- Decomposition of movement: inability properly to sequence fine, coordinated acts.
- Dysarthria: inability to articulate words properly, with slurring and inappropriate phrasing.
- Dysdiadochokinesia: inability to perform rapid, alternating movements.
- Dysmetria: inability to control range of movement.
- Hypotonia: decreased muscle tone.
- Nystagmus: involuntary rapid oscillation of the eyeballs in a horizontal, vertical or rotary direction with the fast component maximal towards the side of the cerebellar lesion.
- Scanning speech: slow enunciation with a tendency to hesitate at the beginning of a word or syllable.
- Tremor: rhythmic, alternating, oscillatory movements of a limb as it approaches a target (*intention tremor*) or of proximal musculature when fixed posture or weight bearing is attempted (*sustention tremor*)

### Q2.107
A 65-yo man has developed obstructive jaundice as a result of a _carcinoma of the head of the pancreas_ obstructing the common bile duct (CBD).

Which of the following *biochemical abnormalities* will be seen in this patient?

	A. Decreased bilirubin in the urine
	B. Decreased urobilinogen in the stool
	C. Increased urobilinogen in the urine
	D. Decreased plasma direct bilirubin
	E. Decreased plasma conjugated bilirubin

#### Answer: C. Increased urobilinogen in the urine - *FALSE* = B. Decreased urobilinogen in the stool - TRUE
- Bilirubin secretion into duodenum is reduced and, hence
	- &darr; urinary excretion of urobilinogen, and 
	- &darr; urobilinogen and stercobilin in colon (*clay-coloured stools*)

##### Notes
- Almost 50% of cases of extrahepatic biliary obstruction have a noncalculous cause, with malignancy being the most frequent
- Most tumours originate in the head of the pancreas, through which the distal common duct normally courses
- Less common tumours may originate in the ampulla, bile duct, gallbladder or liver
- Even less commonly, ducts may be obstructed by metastatic tumours or nodes of lymphoma
- Benign tumours, usually papillomas or villous adenomas, also occur in bile ducts and may cause obstruction
- Obstruction of intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts prevents the normal delivery of conjugated bilirubin to the duodenum
- Hence, conjugated bilirubin (direct bilirubin) regurgitates into the blood, producing jaundice
- Conjugated bilirubin is more water soluble than free bilirubin, and can be filtered by the kidney and excreted in the urine
- Intestinal bilirubin is usually metabolised by bacteria in the distal small intestine to produce urobilinogen, a portion of which is reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation and can be excreted in the urine
- Most of the urobilinogen is further metabolised by colonic bacteria to produce stercobilin, which gives the stool its brown colour

### Q2.108 - LEARN
Scatter throughout the *exocrine tissue of the pancreas* are several hundred thousand clusters of endocrine cells that produce the hormones insulin and glucagon, plus a few other hormones.

Which of the following features do _both insulin and glucagon_ have in common?

	A. Both increase hepatic gluconeogenesis
	B. Both increase hepatic glycogenolysis
	C. Both increase the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase
	D. The secretion of both is increased by hyPOglycaemia
	E. The secretion of both is increased by amino acids in the blood

#### Answer: D. The secretion of both is increased by hyPOglycaemia - *FALSE* = E. The secretion of both is increased by amino acids in the blood - TRUE
- Endocrine portion of pancreas takes the form of many small clusters of cells called *islets of langerhans*
- Humans have roughly a million islets

- Pancreatic islets house three major cell types, each producing a different endocrine product
	1. α cells (A cells) secrete *glucagon*
	2. β cells (B cells) produce *insulin* 
		- most abundant of islet cells
	3. δ cells (D cells) secrete **somatostatin**
		- also produced by a number of other endocrine cells in body
 
- **NOTE** Amino acids (esp. *arginine*) stimulate secretion of both insulin and glucagon
	- HyPOglycaemia *stimulates insulin* secretion, but *inhibits glucagon* release
- Glucagon &uarr; hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis
	- **NOTE** insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis + stimulates glycogen synthesis (*energy storage*)
- Activity of hormone-sensitive lipase is &uarr; by glucagon and &darr; by insulin

### Q2.109
*Urine specific gravity* measures the concentration of particles in the urine. A normal specific-gravity ranges between 1.005 and 1.030. A urine specific gravity that remains the _same when measured during the day or night_ indicates:

	A. Loss of concentrating and diluting capacity
	B. Prerenal azotaemia
	C. A reduction in the solute load
	D. Intact tubular function
	E. Acute glomerular disease

#### Answer: E. Acute glomerular disease - *FALSE* = A. Loss of concentrating and diluting capacity - TRUE
- Specific gravity measures the kidney’s ability to concentrate or dilute urine in relation to plasma
	- As urine is a solution of minerals, salts and compounds in water, the specific gravity is >1.000
- The more concentrated the urine, the higher the urine specific gravity
- An adult’s kidneys have a remarkable ability to concentrate or dilute urine
- In infants, range for specific gravity is less because 
	- immature kidneys are not able to concentrate urine as effectively as mature kidneys

##### Isothenuria 
	- A fixed urine specific gravity (isosthenuria) means that it remains the same at all times, usually around 1.010. 
	- Fixed specific gravity indicates that the kidneys have no concentration or dilution capability and that the glomerular filtrate is iso-osmotic with the plasma all the way through the nephron
	- As concentration and dilution are functions of the renal tubules, a fixed specific gravity always indicates major tubular dysfunction, which commonly occurs in *chronic renal failure* (CRF)
	- Isosthenuria has nothing to do with a reduction in solute load, which would decrease the urine volume
	- Acute glomerulonephritis and prerenal azotaemia both have intact tubular function and normal concentration and dilution capabilities.

##### Increased Urine Specific Gravity - LEARN
- Dehydration
- Fever
- Vomiting
- Diarrhoea
- Diabetes mellitus (DM) and other causes of glycosuria

### Q2.110
Five days after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) a patient developed hyPERkalaemia as a result of taking a *potassium supplement and spironolactone*.

Which of the following therapies will be **ineffective** in treating hyPERkalaemia in this patient?

	A. Intravenous insulin and glucose
	B. Intravenous calcium chloride
	C. Sodium polystyrene sulphonate enema
	D. Oral enalapril
	E. Haemodialysis

#### Answer: B. Intravenous calcium chloride - *FALSE* = D. Oral enalapril - TRUE
- Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor
	- Inhibits ACE and formation of angiotensin II
	- &darr; aldosterone = &uarr; serum potassium
- **NOTE** Enalapril is contraindicated in patients with hyPERkalaemia

##### Notes
- Cardiacarrest may occur at any time during treatment of hyperkalaemia. Hospitalisation and close monitoring are required. The goal of acute treatment is to protect the body from the effects of hyperkalaemia. This may include protective measures, shift of potassium into the ICF and reduction of total body potassium. Emergency treatment is indicated if the potassium is very high or if severe symptoms are present, including changes in the ECG. Intravenous calcium chloride may be given temporarily to counteract the muscular and cardiac effects of hyperkalaemia, including cardiac arrhythmias. Intravenous calcium will counteract symptoms for only about 1 hour, so other treatments should begin immediately. Intravenous glucose and insulin move potassium from the ECF back into the cells. This may reverse severe symptoms long enough to allow correction of the cause of the hyperkalaemia. Sodium bicarbonate causes potassium to shift from ECF to ICF. It may reverse hyperkalaemia caused by acidosis with no other treatment required. Prolonged use of sodium bicarbonate should be avoided because it may cause severe complications.
- Diuretics cause a decrease in total body potassium. They may be prescribed for people who can tolerate the loss of body fluid that accompanies use of a diuretic. Cation-exchange resins, such as sodium polystyrene sulphonate, are chemicals that bind potassium and cause it to be excreted from the gastrointestinal tract. They may be given orally or rectally. Haemodialysis may be used to reduce total body potassium levels, especially if kidney function is compromised. Dialysis is indicated when more conservative measures have failed or are inappropriate.

### Q2.111
A 22-yo woman developed a *pleural effusion*. It was drained and a sample of pleural fluid was sent to laboratory for analysis. Which of the following statements about the _pleural fluid_ is true?

	A. The normal volume of pleural fluid is 125ml
	B. It has an acidic pH
	C. The pleural fluid glucose content is the same as the plasma glucose content
	D. The normal protein content is >40g/L
	E. The normal pleural fluid has no cells

#### Answer: E. The normal pleural fluid has no cells - *FALSE* = C. The pleural fluid glucose content is the same as the plasma glucose content - TRUE
- Pleural fluid is continuously produced and reabsorbed, essentially maintaining equilibrium
- Pleural fluid moves into the pleural space as a result of oncotic and hydrostatic pressure of the systemic circulation 
- Although the reabsorption rate ranges from 20 to 1000ml/24 h, 
	- **NOTE** at any given time there is only 10ml fluid in pleural space
- The lymphatic system, particularly that of the parietal pleura, plays an important role in the reabsorption of excess fluid and proteins
	- pH is >7
	- Protein content is 10–20g/L with 60% albumin
	- Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is <50% plasma LDH
	- **Glucose content is same as plasma glucose content**

### Q2.112
A 26-year-old motorcyclist arrived in the Emergency Department after an accident. He was conscious and haemodynamically stable. The only significant finding was *leakage of clear fluid from the nose*. To confirm the diagnosis of _cerebrospinal fluid_ (CSF) rhinorrhoea a sample of the fluid was sent for immunoelectrophoresis. Which of the following statements about CSF is true?

	A. The normal circulating volume of CSF is 500 mL - F
	B. Circulating CSF is absorbed into the lymphatic circulation through the cranial arachnoid granulations and spinal arachnoid villi
	C. Normal CSF pressure is 100–200 mmHg - F
	D. The normal CSF protein content is 20–45 mg/L
	E. The normal CSF glucose range is 50–100 mg/dL

#### Answer: B. Circulating CSF is absorbed into the lymphatic circulation through the cranial arachnoid granulations and spinal arachnoid villi - *FALSE* = E. The normal CSF glucose range is 50–100 mg/dL - TRUE
- CSF leak may occur from the nose (rhinorrhoea), the external auditory canal (otorrhoea) or a traumatic or surgical defect in the skull or spine
- The fluid leak is a result of meningeal dural and arachnoid laceration with fistula formation
- Blunt trauma is the most common cause. 
- Normal adult subarachnoid fluid has a circulating volume of 90–150ml
- However, nasal mucous secretions and tears also have detectable glucose content
- Therefore, tests used to identify CSF by its glucose content are often false positive (in 45–75% of cases)
- The absence of glucose tends to exclude CSF as the leaking fluid
- The enzyme β2-transferrin is present in CSF and perilymph but not in sinonasal mucus secretions and tears
	- This feature is basis for a specific test for CSF based on immunoelectrophoresis
	
##### Composition of Normal CSF - LEARN
- 500mL CSF is produced daily, primarily from ventricular choroid plexus
	- Circulating CSF is absorbed into venous circulation
	- Mainly through cranial arachnoid granulations and spinal arachnoid villi

- Normal CSF protein content = 20–45mg/**dl**
- **Normal CSF glucose range = 50-100mg/dl** (60% serum glucose value)

### Q2.113
A 45-yo woman developed position-sensitive vertigo accompanied by nausea, vomiting and malaise after a recent viral infection of the vestibular labyrinth, which would resolve after a few days. Which of the following statements about the _vestibular labyrinth_ is true?

	A. The vestibular labyrinth consists of the cochlea and otolith organs
	B. The utricle senses motion in the horizontal plane
	C. The semicircular canals are sensitive to motion in the sagittal plane - F
	D. The sensory portion of the otolith organs is the ampulla
	E. The structure of the utricle and saccule is similar to that of the semicircular canals - F

#### Answer: B. The utricle senses motion in the horizontal plane - TRUE
- The vestibular system is the system of balance. It is also involved in the function of maintaining visual fixation during head movement and in maintaining posture and lower muscular control. It is made of five sensory organs on each side of the head embedded in the petrous portion of the temporal bone: the superior, posterior and lateral semicircular canals, as well as the utricle and saccule. The semicircular canals are orthogonal to each other, ie at right angles. This is similar to the corner of a box where the three sides meet. The semicircular canals are shaped like a torus. There is a dilated end of each semicircular canal called the ampulla where the sensory organ is located. The lateral canal is inclined from the horizontal plane about 30°. The superior and posterior canals are at roughly 45° angles to the sagittal plane.
- Semicircular canals are sensitive to angular accelerations (head rotations). Each semicircular canal is maximally sensitive to motion in the plane of that canal. The canals also act in functional pairs with both canals lying in the same plane. Rotation in that plane will be excitatory to one canal and inhibitory to the other. The left and right lateral canals are one pair. The superior canal on one side is paired with the posterior canal on the opposite side. The otolith organs include the utricle and the saccule. The utricle senses motion in the horizontal plane (eg forward–backward movement, left–right movement, combination thereof). The saccule senses motion in the sagittal plane (eg up–down movement). It lies in the spherical recess on the medial wall of the vestibule and is oriented in the vertical plane. The utricle lies in the elliptical recess on the medial wall of the vestibule and is oriented in the horizontal plane. There are five openings into the area of the utricle from the semicircular canals. The superior and posterior canals share a common crus.
- The membranous labyrinth is enclosed in a bony labyrinth within the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It is surrounded by perilymph and contains endolymph. Perilymph may be formed from an utrafiltrate of blood or CSF. It is similar in ionic concentration to ECF with low K+ and high Na+. The endolymph within the membranous labyrinth is produced by the marginal cells of the stria vascularis in the cochlea and by cells called dark cells in the maculae of the utricle and saccule. Endolymph is absorbed in the endolymphatic sac. It has ionic concentrations similar to intracellular fluid (ICF) with high K+ and low Na+.
- The sensory portion of the semicircular canals is the ampulla, which contains the neuroepithelium called the crista ampullaris, the cupula, supporting cells, connective tissue, blood vessels and nerve fibres. The crista extends perpendicularly across the canal in a saddle shape. The sensory hair cells and supporting cells are modified columnar epithelial cells with microvilli. There are two types of hair cells: type I are flask shaped and have a chalice-shaped nerve ending on them. One calyx nerve ending can synapse with just one or two to four hair cells. Type II hair cells are cylindrical in shape and have multiple efferent and afferent bouton nerve synapses. These hair cells have 50–100 stereocilia and a single kinocilium. These stereocilia are not true cilia but microvilli that are graded in height, with the tallest nearest to the single kinocilium. The kinocilium is located on one end of the cell, giving it a morphological polarisation. The movement of the hair bundle towards the kinocilium causes an increase in the firing rate of the hair cell, whereas deflection away causes a decrease in the firing rate. In the lateral semicircular canals the kinocilium is located on the side nearest the utricle whereas in the superior and posterior semicircular canals it is away from the utricle.
- The structure of the utricle and saccule differs from the semicircular canals. The sensory portion of the otolith organs is the macula. The cilia from the hair cells extend up to reach the statoconial membrane. This is a gelatinous layer with calcareous particles called otoconia embedded in it. The statoconial membrane has a specific gravity higher than the endolymph and moves with linear acceleration, causing movement of the hair bundles. In the central portion of each statoconial membrane is a line called the striola. In the saccule the hair cells are oriented towards the striola whereas in the utricle they are oriented away from the striola.

### Q2.114 - LEARN
The neurological examination of a 63-year-old patient with diabetes reveals a lesion involving the right _anterior spinothalamic tract_ at the level of the _sixth cervical vertebra_. The patient will have:

	A. Contralateral loss of crude touch and pressure sensation below the level of the lesion
	B. Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the lesion
	C. Ipsilateral loss of crude touch and pressure sensation below the level of the lesion
	D. Ipsilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the lesion
	E. Loss of the ability consciously to perceive the position and movements of the ipsilateral limb below the level of the lesion

#### Answer: C. Ipsilateral loss of crude touch and pressure sensation below the level of the lesion - *FALSE* = A. Contralateral loss of crude touch and pressure sensation below the level of the lesion - TRUE
- The anterolateral pathway (also known as the spinothalamic tract) contains two pathways: the anterior spinothalamic tract (neospinothalamic) and the lateral spinothalamic tract (paleospinothalamic). It receives inputs from nociceptors, mechanoreceptors and thermoreceptors. The first-order fibres enter the spinal cord via the dorsal root ganglion; on entering they may travel over a few segments of the spinal cord, forming lissauer’s tract. The first-order fibres synapse with the second-order fibres in the dorsal horn. The second-order fibres decussate in the spinal cord and then ascend in the contralateral anterior or lateral spinothalamic tract. These tracts ascend separately until the medulla, where they run together as the spinal lemniscus. This runs through the pons and midbrain, and synapses with a third-order neuron in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. The third-order neurons leave the thalamus and project to the somatosensory cortex on the postcentral gyrus via the posterior limb of the internal capsule.
- The anterior spinothalamic tract mainly mediates sensations of crude touch and the lateral spinothalamic tract mediates sensations of temperature and pain. A lesion of the anterior spinothalamic tract results in contralateral loss of crude touch and pressure sensation below the level of the lesion. A lesion of the lateral spinothalamic tract results in contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the lesion. A lesion of the medial lemniscus pathway results in loss of ability to perceive consciously the position and movements of the ipsilateral limb below the level of damage. There is also impaired muscle control, loss of vibration sensation and loss of discriminatory touch below the level of the lesion.

### Q2.115
The liver received a _dual blood supply_. Which of the following statements about _hepatic circulation_ is true?

	A. The portal area can hold about three-quarters of the total blood volume
	B. The average minute blood flow in the hepatic circulation is about 300ml/100g of liver tissue
	C. The hepatic artery supplies 50% of the total hepatic blood flow
	D. Pressure in the portal vein is about 8-10mmHg
	E. Hepatic blood flow increases during moderate exercise
	    
#### Answer: A. The portal area can hold about three-quarters of the total blood volume - *FALSE* = D. Pressure in the portal vein is about 8–10 mmHg - TRUE
- Blood enters the liver through two sources
	1. Portal Vein (3/4 blood flow, 60% O2, nutrition, 8-10 mmHg)
	2. Hepatic Artery (1/4 blood flow, 40% O2)
- Hepatic artery is not an end-artery
	- has anastomotic channels with the portal vein at several levels of interlobular regions
- Muscular exercise &darr; splanchnic blood flow by redistributing blood to active muscles and brain

### Q2.116
A 65-yo man had an _embolic stroke_ that affected his _dominant Broca's area_. This patient will have:

	A. Sensory aphasia
	B. Anomic aphasia - F
	C. Receptive aphasia
	D. Global aphasia - F
	E. Motor aphasia
	    
#### Answer: E. Motor aphasia - TRUE
- Broca’s area is the section of the human brain (in the opercular and triangular sections of the inferior frontal gyrus of the frontal lobe of the cortex) that is involved in language processing, speech production and comprehension. It can also be described as Brodmann’s area 44 (and 45) and is connected to Wernicke’s area by a neural pathway called the arcuate fasciculus. Broca’s area is named after Pierre Paul Broca, who first described it in 1861, after conducting a postmortem examination on a speech-impaired patient. 
- There are two main parts of Broca’s area, which express different roles during language comprehension and production:
	1. Pars triangularis (anterior), which is thought to support the interpretation of various ‘modes’ of stimuli (plurimodal association) and the programming of verbal conducts.
	2. Pars opercularis (posterior), which is thought to support the management of only one kind of stimulus (unimodal association) and the coordination of the speech organs for the actual production of language, given its favourable position close to motor-related areas.
 
- People who have damage to this area may show a condition called Broca’s aphasia (sometimes known as expressive aphasia, motor aphasia or non-fluent aphasia), which makes them unable to create grammatically complex sentences: their speech is often described as telegraphic and contains little but content words. Comprehension in Broca’s aphasia is relatively normal, although many studies have demonstrated that those with Broca’s aphasia have trouble understanding certain kinds of syntactically complex sentences.
- This type of aphasia can be contrasted with Wernicke’s aphasia (also known as receptive aphasia) which is characterised by damage to more posterior regions of the left hemisphere (in the superior temporal lobe). Wernicke’s aphasia manifests as a more pronounced impairment in comprehension and speech that seems normal grammatically but is often roundabout, vague or meaningless. Global aphasia is characterised by the complete loss of the ability to comprehend spoken or written language, as well as to express language verbally or orthographically. Verbal expression is limited to words or short automatic phrases such as explicatives. Meaning can sometimes appear to be present because of the emotional content of the explicatives, and comprehension is totally absent even though facial expression and fleeting looks might appear that the patient is comprehending. Repetition and naming are also disturbed.

- The lesion that typically causes a global aphasia involves the whole perisylvian region in the dominant hemisphere. Usually the damage correlates with an infarction involving the middle cerebral artery. If the cortex is involved, the damage stretches from anterior to Broca’s area, deep to the insula, and posterior to the auditory areas and surrounding perisylvian regions. However, the underlying white matter is often also involved. There is usually hemiplegia on the contralateral side, but paresis is not always present. When there is no paresis, recovery tends to be better. Patients with anomic aphasia present with intact repetition, fluent speech and an inability to name things. It may be secondary to recovery from another type of aphasia. Anomic aphasia may represent a mild form of transcortical sensory aphasia, in which other features of semantics are intact. It may be caused by lesions in many brain areas, including the dorsolateral frontal cortex, posterior temporo-occipital cortex and thalamus. A left anterior temporal lesion can also cause anomic aphasia.

### Q2.117
A 78-year-old man with urinary hesitancy and orthostatic hypotension is seen in the Emergency Department. On clinical examination he had pill-rolling movements of his right hand, bradykinesia and rest tremor. The patient most probably has a lesion involving:

	A. The motor cortex
	B. The neostriatum
	C. The substantia nigra
	D. The hypothalamus
	E. The red nucleus
	
#### Answer: C. The substantia nigra - TRUE
- The patient in this question has the classic features of Parkinson’s disease (shaking palsy). It is an idiopathic, slowly progressive, degenerative CNS disorder characterised by slow and decreased movement, muscular rigidity, resting tremor and postural instability. In primary Parkinson’s disease, the pigmented neurons of the substantia nigra, locus ceruleus and other brainstem dopaminergic cell groups are lost. The cause is not known. The loss of substantia nigra neurons, which project to the caudate nucleus and putamen, results in depletion of the neurotransmitter dopamine in these areas. Onset is generally after age 40, with increasing incidence in older age groups.
- Secondary parkinsonism results from loss of or interference with the action of dopamine in the basal ganglia as a result of other idiopathic degenerative diseases, drugs or exogenous toxins. The most common cause of secondary parkinsonism is ingestion of antipsychotic drugs or reserpine, which produces parkinsonism by blocking dopamine receptors. In 50–80% of patients, the disease begins insidiously with a resting 4 to 8Hz pill-rolling tremor of one hand. The tremor is maximal at rest, diminishes during movement and is absent during sleep; it is enhanced by emotional tension or fatigue. Usually, the hands, arms and legs are most affected, in that order. Jaw, tongue, forehead and eyelids may also be affected, but the voice escapes the tremor.

- In many patients, only rigidity occurs; tremor is absent. Rigidity progresses, and movement becomes slow (bradykinesia), decreased (hypokinesia) and difficult to initiate (akinesia). Rigidity and hypokinesia may contribute to muscular aches and sensations of fatigue. The face becomes mask-like, with the mouth open and diminished blinking, which may be confused with depression. The posture becomes stooped. Patients find it difficult to start walking; the gait becomes shuffling with short steps, and the arms are held flexed to the waist and do not swing with the stride. Steps may inadvertently quicken, and the patient may break into a run to keep from falling (festination). The tendency to fall forwards (propulsion) or backwards (retropulsion) when the centre of gravity is displaced results from loss of postural reflexes. Speech becomes hypophonic, with a characteristic monotonous, stuttering dysarthria. Hypokinesia and impaired control of distal musculature results in micrographia and increasing difficulty with activities of daily living. Dementia affects about 50% of patients, and depression is common.
- During examination, passive movement of the limbs is met with a plastic, unvarying, lead-pipe rigidity; superimposed tremor bursts may have a ratchet-like cog-wheel quality. The sensory examination is usually normal. Signs of autonomic nervous system dysfunction (eg seborrhoea, constipation, urinary hesitancy, orthostatic hypotension) may be found. Muscle strength is usually normal, although useful power may be diminished and the ability to perform rapid successive movements is impaired. Reflexes remain normal but may be difficult to elicit in the presence of marked tremor or rigidity.

### Q2.118
A weightlifter was banned from competing in international events after unusually _high levels of testosterone_ were detected in his blood during random dope testing at the commonwealth Games. Which of the following statements about testosterone is true?

	A. It binds to the cell surface receptor
	B. It is reduced to dehydroepiandrosterone by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5 reductase
	C. It decreases bone density - F
	D. It stimulates bone marrow
	E. It has no effect on the larynx - F

#### Answer: D. It stimulates bone marrow - TRUE
- Testosterone is a steroid hormone from the androgen group. Testosterone is secreted in the testes of men and the ovaries of women. It is the principal male sex hormone and the ‘original’ anabolic steroid. The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to oestradiol and activation of certain oestrogen receptors. Free testosterone is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5β-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5β-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than testosterone, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of testosterone. The testosterone-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects.
- The bones and the brain are two important tissues in humans where the primary effect of testosterone is by way of aromatisation to oestradiol. In general, androgens promote protein synthesis and growth of those tissues with androgen receptors. Testosterone effects can be classified as virilising and anabolic effects, although the distinction is somewhat artificial, because many of the effects can be considered both. Anabolic effects include growth of muscle mass and strength, increased bone density and strength, and stimulation of height growth and bone maturation. Virilising effects include maturation of the sex organs, particularly the penis and the formation of the scrotum in fetuses, and after birth (usually at puberty) a deepening of the voice, and growth of the beard and torso hair. Many of these fall into the category of male secondary sex characters. Increased testosterone causes deepening of the voice in both sexes at puberty. Testosterone is also often used by bodybuilders and weightlifters to enhance muscle build.

### Q2.119
Immunoglobulins are glycoproteins in the immunoglobulin superfamily that function as *antibodies*. They are grouped into five classes or isotypes:
- IgG
- IgA
- IgM
- IgD
- IgE

Which of the following statement about *Ig isotypes* is true?

	A. IgG is the most abundant immunoglobulin
	B. IgA is the only isotype that can pass through placenta
	C. IgM has the smallest molecular mass
	D. IgD mainly acts as opsonin
	E. IgE is a polymeric immunoglobulin

#### Answer: B. IgA is the only isotype that can pass through placenta - *FALSE* = A. IgG is the most abundant immunoglobulin - TRUE
- According to differences in their heavy chain constant domains, immunoglobulins are grouped into five classes, or isotypes: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and IgE. 

##### IgG
- IgG is a monomeric immunoglobulin, built of two heavy chains and two light chains. Each molecule has two antigen-binding sites. This is the most abundant immunoglobulin and is approximately equally distributed in blood and in tissue liquids. This is the only isotype that can pass through the placenta, thereby providing protection to the fetus in its first weeks of life before its own immune system has developed. It can bind to many kinds of pathogens, eg viruses, bacteria and fungi, and protects the body against them by complement activation (classic pathway), opsonisation for phagocytosis and neutralisation of their toxins. There are four subclasses: IgG1 (66%), IgG2 (23%), IgG3 (7%) and IgG4 (4%). IgG1, IgG3 and IgG4 cross the placenta easily. IgG3 is the most effective complement activator, followed by IgG1 and then IgG2. IgG4 does not activate complement. IgG1 and IgG3 bind with high affinity to Fc receptors on phagocytic cells. IgG4 has intermediate affinity and IgG2 affinity is extremely low.

##### IgA
- IgA represents about 15–20% of immunoglobulins in the blood, although it is primarily secreted across the mucosal tract into the stomach and intestines. It is also found in maternal milk, tears and saliva. This immunoglobulin helps to fight against pathogens that contact the body surface and are ingested or inhaled. It does not activate complement and opsonises only weakly. Its heavy chains are of the type α. It exists in two forms – IgA1 (90%) and IgA2 (10%) – that differ in structure.

##### IgM
- IgM forms polymers where multiple immunoglobulins are covalently linked together with disulphide bonds, normally as a pentamer or occasionally as a hexamer. It has a large molecular mass of about 900kDa (in its pentamer form). The J chain is attached to most pentamers, whereas hexamers do not possess the J chain as a result of space constraints in the complex. As each monomer has two antigen binding sites, an IgM has ten of them; however, it cannot bind ten antigens at the same time because they hinder each other. As it is a large molecule, it cannot diffuse well and is found in the interstitium only in very low quantities. IgM is primarily found in serum; however, because of the J chain, it is also important as a secretory immunoglobulin. As a result of its polymeric nature, IgM possesses high avidity, and is particularly effective at complement activation. It is also a so-called ‘natural antibody’: it is found in the serum with no evidence of prior contact with antigen.

##### IgD
- IgD makes up about 1% of proteins in the plasma membranes of mature naive B lymphocytes (co-expressed with IgM) and is also found in serum in very small amounts. It is monomeric and incorporates the δ heavy chain in its structure. IgD’s function is currently unknown, because mice lacking IgD seem to retain normal immune responses (implying redundancy if not lack of function), and IgD ceases to be expressed in activated B lymphocytes. It may function as a regulatory antigen receptor.

##### IgE
- IgE is a monomeric immunoglobulin with the heavy chain ε. It contains a high proportion of carbohydrates. Its molecular mass is 190kDa. It can be found on the surface of the plasma membranes of basophils and mast cells of connective tissue. IgE plays a role in immediate hypersensitivity and the defence against parasites such as worms. The IgE antibodies are also present in outer excretions. They do not activate complement. Only IgE is heat labile.

### Q2.120
Serial lactate determinations may be helpful in patients resuscitated from shock to assess the adequacy of therapies. Which of the following statements about _lactate_ is true?

	A. The normal blood lactate concentration in unstressed patients is 2.5–3.5mmol/L
	B. The cori cycle deals with conversion of glucose to lactate and vice versa 
	C. Lactate turnover in healthy resting humans is approximately 130mmol every 24 hours
	D. Lactate producers are the liver, kidneys and heart
	E. Lactate is a by-product of glycogenolysis

#### Answer: E. Lactate is a by-product of glycogenolysis - *FALSE* = B. The cori cycle deals with conversion of glucose to lactate and vice versa - TRUE
- The normal blood lactate concentration in unstressed patients is 0.5–1mmol/L. Patients with critical illness can be considered to have normal lactate concentrations <2mmol/L. Hyperlactataemia is defined as a mild-to-moderate (2–5mmol/L) persistent increase in blood lactate concentration without metabolic acidosis, whereas lactic acidosis is characterised by persistently increased blood lactate levels (usually >5mmol/L) in association with metabolic acidosis. Hyperlactataemia generally occurs in the settings of adequate tissue perfusion, intact buffering systems and adequate tissue oxygenation. Lactic acidosis is associated with major metabolic dysregulation, tissue hypoperfusion, effects of certain drugs or toxins or congenital abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism. Lactic acidosis is divided into two categories: type A and type B (cohen and Woods). Type A is lactic acidosis occurring in association with clinical evidence of poor tissue perfusion or oxygenation of blood (eg hypotension, cyanosis, cool and clammy extremities). Type B is lactic acidosis occurring when no clinical evidence of poor tissue perfusion or oxygenation exists. The metabolism of glucose to lactate by one tissue, such as RBCs, and conversion of lactate to glucose by another tissue, such as the liver, is termed the ‘Cori cycle’. The ability of the liver to consume lactate is concentration dependent and progressively decreases as the level of blood lactate increases.
- Lactate uptake by the liver is also impaired by several other factors, including acidosis, hypoperfusion and hypoxia. The arterial concentration of lactate depends on the rates of its production and use by various organs. Blood lactate concentration is normally maintained <2mmol/L, although lactate turnover in healthy resting humans is about 1300mmol every 24 h. Lactate producers are skeletal muscle, the brain, gut and erythrocytes. Lactate metabolisers are the liver, kidneys and heart. When lactate blood levels exceed 4mmol/L, the skeletal muscle becomes a net consumer of lactate.
- Lactate is a byproduct of glycolysis and is formed in the cytosol catalysed by the enzyme LDH as shown below:
	- Pyruvate + NADH + H+ = Lactate + NAD+
- This is a reversible reaction that favours lactate synthesis with a lactate: pyruvate ratio that is normally 25:1. Lactate synthesis increases when the rate of pyruvate formation in the cytosol exceeds its rate of use by the mitochondria. This occurs when a rapid increase in metabolic rate occurs or when oxygen delivery to the mitochondria declines, such as in tissue hypoxia. Lactate synthesis may also occur when the rate of glucose metabolism exceeds the oxidative capacity of the mitochondria, as observed with administration of catecholamines or errors of metabolism.
- Shock currently is conceptualised as a clinical syndrome resulting from an imbalance between tissue oxygen demands and tissue oxygen supply. Impaired oxygen delivery is the primary problem in hypovolaemic, cardiogenic, distributive (septic) and obstructive (pericardial tamponade, tension pneumothorax) forms of shock. When tissue hypoxia is present, pyruvate oxidation decreases, lactate production increases and ATP formation continues via glycolysis. The amount of lactate produced is believed to correlate with the total oxygen debt, the magnitude of hypoperfusion and the severity of shock. Serial lactate determinations may be helpful in patients resuscitated from shock to assess the adequacy of therapies.
