### Q2.1
A 63-year-old man’s blood pressure was high as he wrongly omitted taking his antihypertensive medication on the day of surgery. An _increase in systemic blood pressure_ leads to which one of the following effects?

	A. A decrease in the maximal wall tension in the left ventricle
	B. A decrease in the time it takes for the left ventricular wall to develop peak tension
	C. An increase in cardiac output
	D. An increase in the residual volume of blood in the left ventricle
	E. An increase in the velocity at which blood is ejected from the left ventricle

#### Answer: D. An increase in the residual volume of blood in the left ventricle - TRUE
- An increase in the systemic pressure (ie, the afterload that the ventricle must overcome) reduces the velocity of shortening of contractile elements in the muscle. An increase in afterload also reduces the extent of muscle shortening, which results in a decreased stroke volume and consequently, an increased residual volume (ie, the volume of blood left in the ventricles at the end of ejection).
- The time that it takes for the left ventricular wall to develop peak tension is not reduced because the velocity of contraction is reduced and the peak tension is increased. Wall tension is a function of the product of ventricular pressure and volume. Because pressure and volume are increased, wall tension also is increased in the presence of an increased afterload.

### Q2.2
A 26-year-old man involved in road traffic accident is brought to the Emergency Department with considerable blood loss from his fractured right femur. He is given transfusion to increase the preload of the cardiac muscle. Increasing the _preload_:

	A. Decreases the initial velocity of shortening of the cardiac muscle
	B. Decreases the time it takes the muscle to reach peak tension
	C. Increases the ventricular wall tension
	D. Reduces the peak tension of the muscle
	E. Reduces the ventricular end-diastolic pressure

#### Answer: C. Increases the ventricular wall tension - TRUE
- Increasing the cardiac muscle preload increases the ventricular wall tension. An increase in both end-diastolic pressure and volume is synonymous with an increased preload. The increased preload causes a more forceful ventricular contraction, which results in an increase in the peak pressure generated by the ventricle as well as an increase in the stroke volume. This intrinsic property of the myocardium is termed the Frank Starling mechanism. The increased preload results in an increased velocity of shortening, but because the peak pressure increases, the time to peak pressure usually remains constant under these conditions.

### Q2.3
A 22-year-old athlete is running the London marathon. Which one of the following mechanisms is the _most important for maintaining increased blood flow_ to this athlete’s skeletal muscles?

	A. An increase in aortic pressure
	B. An increase in -adrenergic impulses
	C. An increase in -adrenergic impulses
	D. Vasoconstriction in the splanchnic and renal areas
	E. Vasodilation secondary to the effects of local metabolites

#### Answer: E. Vasodilation secondary to the effects of local metabolites - TRUE

### Q2.4
A patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoes measurement of his lung volumes and capacities prior to undergoing major abdominal surgery. The volume of gas in his lungs at the end of a normal expiration is referred to as the:

	A. Expiratory reserve volume (ERV)
	B. Functional residual capacity (FRC)
	C. Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV)
	D. Residual volume (RV)
	E. Total lung capacity (TLC)
	
#### Answer: B. Functional residual capacity (FRC) - TRUE
- The functional residual capacity (FRC) is the volume of gas in the lungs at the end of normal expiration. Since expiration is passive, the lung volume decreases during expiration until the equilibrium volume (ie, the FRC) is reached. The equilibrium volume represents the volume of a distensible structure when the transmural pressure (ie, the pressure inside minus the pressure outside) is zero. The residual volume is the volume of gas in the lungs following maximal expiration. The expiratory reserve volume is the volume of gas that can be forcefully expired after normal expiration, and the inspiratory reserve volume is the additional volume gas that can be inspired over the tidal volume. The total lung capacity is the volume of gas in the lungs after maximal inspiration.

### Q2.5
Following extubation, ABG analysis of a patient showed raised PaCO2 levels. _HyPERcapnia affects respiration_ primarily by stimulating the:

	A. Arterial baroreceptors
	B. Carotid and aortic bodies
	C. Central (medullary) chemoreceptors
	D. Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)
	E. J receptors
	
#### Answer: B. Carotid and aortic bodies - *FALSE* = C. Central (medullary) chemoreceptors - TRUE
- Approximately 85% of the effect of CO2 on the respiratory drive is mediated through the central (medullary) chemoreceptors; only 15% of the effect comes from the carotid and aortic bodies (ie, the peripheral chemoreceptors). CO2 readily crosses the blood–brain barrier, but charged ions (ie, H+) do not. The hydration and subsequent dissociation of CO2 into H+ and HCO3– after it crosses the blood– brain barrier increases the H+ concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the brain tissues stimulating respiration. J receptors, arterial baroreceptors, and the hypoglossal nerve are not affected by changes in CO2.

### Q2.6
A 47-year-old man who is breathing air at sea level has a respiratory exchange ratio of 1. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals: pH = 7.52, PaO2 = 85 mmHg (11.3 kPa), and PaCO2 = 30 mmHg (4.0 kPa). This patient’s arterial blood gas analysis is suggestive of which one of the following?

	A. He has been hypoventilating
	B. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
	C. He has metabolic alkalosis
	D. His alveolar-to-arterial O2 tension difference exceeds 20 mmHg
	E. His plasma bicarbonate levels are increased

#### Answer: E. His plasma bicarbonate levels are increased - *FALSE* = D. His alveolar-to-arterial O2 tension difference exceeds 20 mmHg - TRUE
- pH: alkalotic; PaO2: normal; PaCO2: **LOW** = Respiratory Alkalosis
- This patient has an alveolar-to-arterial O2 tension difference of 35mmHg. To calculate this, the alveolar O2 tension (PAo2) must be determined using the alveolar gas equation. Given an arterial CO2 tension of 30mmHg, the alveolar O2 tension is determined as:
- PaO2 = (760 – 47) × 0.21 – 30 = 150 – 30 = 120mmHg
- Thus, the alveolar-to-arterial O2 tension difference is 120 – 85, or 35mmHg. This patient’s low arterial CO2 tension and high pH indicate that he has respiratory alkalosis, and he has been hyperventilating and does not have metabolic alkalosis. Respiratory alkalosis causes a decrease in plasma bicarbonate levels due to the slope of the blood buffer line. Lastly, COPD leads to hypoxia and CO2 retention, not hyperventilation.

### Q2.7
Which one of the following acid-base changes is characteristic of hyPERventilation?

	A. Plasma pH = 7.27, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 37, urine pH = acid
	B. Plasma pH = 7.31, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 16, urine pH = acid
	C. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 15, urine pH = alkaline
	D. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 24, urine pH = acid
	E. Plasma pH = 7.55, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 22, urine pH = alkaline
	
#### Answer: E. Plasma pH = 7.55, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 22, urine pH = alkaline - *FALSE* = C. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 15, urine pH = alkaline - TRUE
- HyPERventilation: **L** PaCO2 = **H** pH (> 7.45); normal HCO3- (21-28 mEq/L) → E
- Hyperventilation is defined as alveolar ventilation in excess of the body’s needs for CO2 elimination, which results in decreased arterial CO2 tension – the underlying factor in respiratory alkalosis. Although CO2 tension is not given it can be calculated using the mathematical relationship: [HCO3–]/S.Paco2 = 20/1. Applying this equation, it is clear that the value in set C indicate a decrease in CO2 tension:
- 15/S.PaCO2 = 20/1, or S.PaCO2 = 0.75mmol/L
	- Because: S.PaCO2 = 0.75mmol/L
	- And: S = 0.03mmol/L/mmHg,
	- Then: PaCO2 = 0.75/0.03 = 25mmHg
- A CO2 tension of 25mmHg is significantly lower than normal (40mmHg). In acute respiratory alkalosis, there is a decrease in urinary H+ excretion and an increase in urinary HCO3– excretion. In this case, there has been complete renal compensation, as evidenced by the return of the [HCO3–]/S.Paco2 ratio to normal (20:1).

### Q2.8
Which one of the following acid-base changes is characteristic of _chronic respiratory tract obstruction_ by a tracheal tumour?

	A. Plasma pH = 7.27, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 37, urine pH = acid
	B. Plasma pH = 7.31, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 16, urine pH = acid
	C. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 15, urine pH = alkaline
	D. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 24, urine pH = acid
	E. Plasma pH = 7.55, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 22, urine pH = alkaline
	
#### Answer: A. Plasma pH = 7.27, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 37, urine pH = acid - TRUE
- COPD: **H** CO2 = **L** pH (< 7.35); chronic = compensation = high HCO3- (>28 mEq/L) → A
- In chronic respiratory tract obstruction (eg, due to tracheal stenosis or tumour), alveolar ventilation is insufficient to excrete CO2 at a rate required by the body, which leads to increased arterial CO2 tension – the underlying factor in respiratory acidosis. The kidney increases H+ secretion, resulting in the addition of HCO3– to the extracellular fluid. The values in set A correspond with these changes. In this case, there is partial compensation of the respiratory acidosis as evidenced by the increase in [HCO3–]. In chronic respiratory acidosis, the respiratory centre become less sensitive to hypercapnia and acidosis and relies on the associated hypoxemia as the primary drive to ventilation. Correction of the low O2 tension by the administration of O2 will diminish respiratory drive, resulting in hypoventilation, a further increase in CO2 tension, and possibly CO2 narcosis. For this reason, O2 must be given with extreme caution to patients with chronic hypercapnia.

### Q2.9
Which one of the following is most likely to _increase the glomerular filtration rate_ (GFR)?

	A. Decreased net filtration pressure
	B. Increased arterial plasma oncotic pressure
	C. Increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure
	D. Increased hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s capsule - F
	E. Vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole - F
	
#### Answer: C. Increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure - TRUE
- The major determinant of the GFR is the hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus. An increase in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure is a major force that drives fluid out of the glomerular capillary and into Bowman’s capsule. In glomerular capillaries, the net movement of fluid is primarily out of the capillaries, whereas in systemic capillaries, the change in balance of Starling forces is such that net movement out of the capillaries is nearly balanced by net return of fluid into the vessels. Increases in the plasma oncotic pressure, hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s space, and afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction decrease the GFR, as does a decrease in the net filtration pressure.

### Q2.10
Which one of the following is most likely to be seen in a 48-year-old woman who presented to the Emergency Department with _severe vomiting secondary to pyloric obstruction_?

	A. Acid urine - F
	B. A decrease in arterial CO2 tension - F
	C. An increase in alveolar ventilation - F
	D. An increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration
	E. HyPERchloraemia - F
	
#### Answer: D. An increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration - TRUE
- The severe loss of gastric fluid in this patient would produce metabolic alkalosis due to loss of HCl (a non-carbonic acid). She also would have hypovolaemia due to the fluid loss. The development of alkalosis is sensed by the chemoreceptors controlling ventilation, resulting in hypoventilation, and an increase in the arterial CO2 tension (hypercapnia), which reduces the pH towards normal. The kidneys would be expected to excrete the excess bicarbonate, raising the urinary pH.


Questions 2.11-2.20
-------------------

30% - F: 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

### Q2.11
An athlete has a cardiac index 6.5L/min/m^2, haemoglobin concentration 12g/dL, venous O2 tension 30 mmHg, and venous O2 saturation 50%. Assuming 100% haemoglobin saturation in arterial blood, what is this patient’s O2 consumption?

	A. 150 mL/min/m2
	B. 275 mL/min/m2
	C. 520 mL/min/m2
	D. 790 mL/min/m2
	E. 1,030 mL/min/m2
	
#### Answer: C. 520 mL/min/m2 (*Guess*) - TRUE
- This athlete’s O2 consumption is 520ml/min/m2. O2 consumption can be determined using the Fick principle, an important concept that has wide applicability in physiology and medicine. To calculate O2 consumption (VO2), the Fick principle is expressed as:
- VO2 = Q x (CaO2 - CvO2), where
	- Q = blood flow and CaO2 – CvO2 = the arteriovenous O2 difference
- In this problem, the cardiac index equals the blood flow
	- Because arterial haemoglobin saturation is assumed to be 100%
		- the arterial O2 content (CaO2) equals the O2 capacity 
		- which equals haemoglobin: 1.34, or 16ml/dL (160ml/L)
- Substituting these values in the above equation gives:
	- VO2 = 6.5 x (160 – 80) = 520 mL/min
- It is important to use similar units for blood flow and O2 content
- In addition, converting O2 content to mL/L before calculating is recommended

### Q2.12
A _decrease in the total osmotic pressure_ of arterial blood would lead to an _increase in urine volume_ by:

	A. Directly inhibiting the reabsorption of water by the collecting ducts - F
	B. Increasing the hydrostatic pressure inside the glomerulus - F
	C. Increasing the permeability of the glomerular capillaries to water - F
	D. Inhibiting vasopressin secretion - F
	E. Stimulating the secretion of aldosterone
	
#### Answer: E. Stimulating the secretion of aldosterone - *FALSE* = D. Inhibiting vasopressin secretion - TRUE
- A decrease in plasma osmolality (osmolarity) leads to a decrease in ADH secretion. This results in an increase in free-water clearance and diuresis. These osmoreceptors are found in the vicinity of the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. ADH augments the water permeability of the cortical collecting duct and the water and urea permeability of the medullary collecting duct. It increases renal water reabsorption, resulting in the excretion of a small volume of hypertonic urine. The major stimuli for ADH are an increase in the plasma osmolality and a decrease in the effective circulating blood volume. Aldosterone promotes Na+ reabsorption, which leads to water retention.

### Q2.13
Body fluid analysis of a 36-year-old male patient with _phaeochromocytoma_ is most likely to reveal a _low plasma concentration_ of:

	A. Free fatty acids
	B. Fasting glucose
	C. Insulin
	D. Lactate
	E. Pyruvate

#### Answer: C. Insulin - TRUE
- Phaeochromocytoma is an adrenal medullary tumour characterised by the hypersecretion of catecholamines, usually noradrenaline (norepinephrine). Catecholamines block insulin release (hypoinsulinaemia) and increase both gluconeogenesis and fatty acid mobilization, which account for glucose intolerance, fasting hyperglycaemia, and glycosuria. The break down of muscle glycogen leads to elevated plasma pyruvate or lactate levels. The metabolic features of phaeochromocytoma resemble hyperthyroidism and include tremor, weight loss, heat intolerance, and increased basal metabolic rate. The cardinal sign is hypertension, which may be persistent or paroxysmal. Patients usually complain of attacks that may be precipitated by emotion or physical exercise, and consist of pounding headaches, sweating, pallor, pain or tightness in the chest, apprehension, paraesthesia, nausea, and vomiting.

### Q2.14
A semicomatose 17-yo girl is brought to ED with _dry skin_, _hyperventilation_ and a _rapid pulse_. The following blood results were obtained:

Name	| Value    			| Range			|
--------|------------------:|--------------:|
pH   	| 7.14      		| 7.35-7.45
pCO2 	| 30 mmHg (4 kPa)  	| NORMAL
Na   	| 140 mEq/L 		| NORMAL
K    	| 4.5 mEq/L 		| NORMAL
Cl   	| 82 mEq/L  		| LOW
HCO3 	| 11 mEq/L  		| 21.0-28.0
Glu  	| 180 mg/dL			| HIGH

What is the _most likely diagnosis_ based on the above clinical presentation and laboratory data?

	A. Hypoglycaemia
	B. Metabolic acidosis
	C. Metabolic alkalosis
	D. Respiratory acidosis
	E. Respiratory alkalosis
	
#### Answer: B. Metabolic acidosis - TRUE (hyPERglycaemia, due to DKA)
- The decrease in arterial pH, HCO3–, and CO2 tension is consistent with metabolic acidosis. There is also a decreased HCO3–/S. PCO2 ratio and widened anion gap. The primary disturbance is the marked reduction in HCO3– and the compensatory response in hyperventilation (as indicated by the hypocapnia). The hyperglycaemia and dehydration (as evidenced by dry skin) support a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.

### Q2.15
A 56-year-old patient is taking _spironolactone_ (an aldosterone antagonist). What will be the effects of this drug on Na+ and K+ excretion?

	A. Na+ = decreased; K+ = decreased
	B. Na+ = decreased; K+ = increased
	C. Na+ = increased; K+ = decreased
	D. Na+ = increased; K+ = increased
	E. Na+ = increased; K+ = unchanged

#### Answer: B. Na+ = decreased; K+ = increased (*Guess*) - *FALSE* = C. Na+ = increased; K+ = decreased - TRUE
- Spironolactone is a competitive aldosterone antagonist that interferes with the aldosterone-stimulated Na+ reabsorption in the distal tubular cell and in the collecting duct. Inhibition of Na+ reabsorption is associated with a marked decrease in urinary excretion of K+ and H+. Spironolactone is effective as a diuretic in individuals with normal renal function or in patients on a low Na+ diet, but not in patients who have undergone adrenalectomy.

### Q2.16
Which one of the following secretions is most dependent on _vagal stimulation_?

	A. Bile
	B. Hydrochloric acid
	C. Pancreatic juice
	D. Pepsin
	E. Saliva

#### Answer: B. Hydrochloric acid - *FALSE* = E. Saliva - TRUE
- Salivary flow is entirely dependent on autonomic nervous system. Vagal stimulation produces a large volume of watery fluid, while sympathetic stimulation causes the secretion of proteins (mucus and some enzymes). Secretion of hydrochloric acid, bile, pepsin, and pancreatic juice is influenced by vagal stimulation but can occur without it.

### Q2.17
A patient with loss of fluid from the gastrointestinal tract has _acidosis_ and _hyPOkalaemia_. The fluid is most likely drained from the:

	A. Colon
	B. Gallbladder
	C. Intestine
	D. Pancreas
	E. Stomach	
	
#### Answer: E. Stomach - *FALSE* = A. Colon - TRUE
- Although acidosis can result from loss of fluid from both intestine and colon, only colon secretes K+
- Thus, excessive fluid loss from colon will result in both _acidosis_ and _hyPOkalaemia_

### Q2.18
The duty FY doctor request an ABG analysis after examining a 23-yo woman in the ED. The following results are obtained:

Name	| Value    			| Range			|
--------|------------------:|--------------:|
pH   	| 7.6       		| 7.35-7.45
pCO2 	| 20 mmHg (2.7 kPa)	| VERY LOW
PO2  	| 98 mmHg (13.0 kPa | normal
Na   	| 140 mEq/L 		| normal
K    	| 3 mEq/L   		| LOW
Cl   	| 109 mEq/L 		| HIGH
HCO3 	| 19 mEq/L  		| slightly LOW

These results suggest that the most likely diagnosis is:

	A. Hypoxia - F
	B. Metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation - F
	C. Metabolic alkalosis
	D. Obstructive lung disease - F
	E. Respiratory alkalosis

#### Answer: C. Metabolic alkalosis - *FALSE* = E. Respiratory alkalosis - TRUE
- The most likely diagnosis is respiratory alkalosis resulting from anxiety-induced hyperventilation. The key determinants of the cause and compensation of the acid–base disorder are the arterial CO2 tension and HCO3–. The greater reduction in CO2 tension than HCO3– indicates that the primary disturbance is respiratory alkalosis. That both the arterial HCO3– and H+ change in the same direction further supports the diagnosis of a respiratory acid–base imbalance. Both obstructive and restrictive lung diseases are common causes of respiratory acidosis.

### Q2.19
A 38-year-old man undergoes lung volume studies using the helium dilution method. The test begins at the end of a normal expiration. The initial fraction of helium in the spirometer is 0.05, and the helium fraction after equilibration with the lungs is 0.03. The volume of gas in the spirometer is kept constant at 4L during the procedure by the addition of O2. According to a spirogram, this patient’s vital capacity is 5L and his expiratory reserve volume is 2L. What is this patient’s functional residual capacity (FRC)?

What is this patient's functional residual capacity (FRC)?

	A. 1.0L
	B. 1.7L
	C. 2.7L
	D. 3.0L
	E. 5.0L
	
#### Answer: B. 1.7L (*Guess*) - *FALSE* = C. 2.7L - TRUE
- This patient’s FRC is 2.7L. The dilution test measures the FRC, the lung volume at the beginning of the test. Because the volume of the gas in the spirometer is kept constant, the degree of dilution produced by the lungs after equilibration must be determined by calculating the ratio of the initial fraction of helium to the fraction of helium following equilibration (F1/F2), which equals 0.05/0.03 or 1.67. Thus, the volume of the spirometer plus the lung volume is 1.67 times the volume of the spirometer, or 1.67 × 4 = 6.7L. Subtracting the volume of the spirometer leaves the lung volume at the start of the test (ie, FRC), or 6.7 – 4 = 2.7L.

### Q2.20
A 38-year-old man undergoes lung volume studies using the helium dilution method. The test begins at the end of a normal expiration. The initial fraction of helium in the spirometer is 0.05, and the helium fraction after equilibration with the lungs is 0.03. The volume of gas in the spirometer is kept constant at 4L during the procedure. What is this patient's residual volume (RV)?

	A. 0.7L
	B. 1.0L
	C. 1.7L
	D. 2.7L
	E. 3.0L

#### Answer: C. 1.7L (*Guess*) - *FALSE* = A. 0.7L - TRUE
- Residual volume (RV) is determined as follows: RV = FRC – ERV, where FRC = functional residual capacity and ERV = expiratory reserve volume.
In order to calculate RV, FRC needs to be calculated first. The dilution test measures the FRC, the lung volume at the beginning of the test. Because the volume of the gas in the spirometer is kept constant, the degree of dilution produced by the lungs after equilibration must be determined by calculating the ratio of the initial fraction of helium to the fraction of helium following equilibration (F1/F2), which equals 0.05/0.03 or 1.67. Thus, the volume of the spirometer plus the lung volume is 1.67 times the volume of the spirometer, or 1.67 × 4 = 6.7L. 
- Subtracting the volume of spirometer leaves lung volume at the start of test (i.e. FRC), or 6.7 – 4 = 2.7L.
- Now, substituting the values for FRC and ERV in the equation RV = FRC – ERV, RV = 2.7 – 2.0 = 0.7L.


Questions 2.21-2.30
-------------------

50% - F: 21, 23, 24, 25, 26

### Q2.21
Insulin is produced by the Beta-cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Insulin secretion from endocrine pancreas is inhibited by:

	A. Glucagon
	B. a2-Adrenergic agonists
	C. 2-Adrenergic agonists
	D. Cholecystokinin 
	E. Muscarinic agonists
	
#### Answer: A. Glucagon - *FALSE* = B. a2-Adrenergic agonists - TRUE
- Low levels of glucose in the circulation and substances that inhibit glucose metabolism, such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose, inhibit insulin. Insulin is also inhibited by decreased amounts of fatty acids and amino acids. The actions of somatostatin, sympathetic nervous stimulation and adrenaline (epinephrine) through α-adrenergic receptors are all inhibitory to insulin release. On the other hand, glucose is the principal stimulus for insulin release. Within 10 minutes of eating a meal rich in carbohydrates, especially simple sugars, blood glucose levels rise above 80mg/dl and this is sufficient to stimulate the release and synthesis of insulin. In general, naturally occurring hexoses and trioses, monosaccharides that can be metabolised, are more potent stimuli of insulin secretion than those that cannot be metabolised, such as mannose. The oral administration of glucose tends to augment the release of insulin because glucose absorption stimulates the secretion of gastrointestinal (GI) hormones that also stimulate insulin secretion. Gastric inhibitory peptide is the most important GI hormone to stimulate insulin release, but gastrin, secretin and cholecystokinin also play a role. Some amino acids stimulate the secretion of insulin. The two most effective are the essential amino acids arginine and lysine. Fatty acids and ketone bodies cause little if any increase in insulin secretion. Glucagon, growth hormone and adrenaline, acting through its β receptor, all stimulate insulin release, as do parasympathetic nervous system stimulation and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).

### Q2.22
Vasopressin is release from the posterior pituitary gland when these is a decrease in plasma:

	A. [Potassium]
	B. [Sodium]
	C. pH
	D. [Volume]
	E. [Calcium]
	
#### Answer: D. [Volume] - TRUE
- Several mechanisms regulate the release of vasopressin, the most important of which are:
	- Hypovolaemia or decreased plasma volume, as occurs during haemorrhage and dehydration, results in a decrease in atrial pressure. Specialised stretch receptors within the atrial walls and large veins (cardiopulmonary baroreceptors) entering the atria decrease their firing rate when there is a fall in atrial pressure. Afferent nerve fibres from these receptors synapse within the nucleus tractus solitarius of the medulla, which sends fibres to the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that controls ADH release by the posterior pituitary. Atrial receptor firing normally inhibits the release of ADH by the posterior pituitary. With hypovolaemia or decreased central venous pressure, the decreased firing of atrial stretch receptors leads to an increase in ADH release.
	- Hypotension, which decreases arterial baroreceptor firing and leads to enhanced sympathetic activity, increases ADH release.
	- Hypothalamic osmoreceptors sense extracellular osmolarity and stimulate ADH release when osmolarity rises, as occurs with dehydration.
	- Angiotensin II receptors located in a region of the hypothalamus regulate ADH release
		- an increase in angiotensin II stimulates ADH release.

### Q2.23
The second heart sound is produced by the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. Closure of the aortic valve occurs at the onset of:

	A. The rapid ejection phase of the cardiac cycle
	B. The isovolumetic _contraction_ phase of the cardiac cycle
	C. The protodiastole
	D. The rapid filling phase of the cardiac cycle
	E. The isovolumetric _relaxation_ phase of the cardiac cycle
	
#### Answer: D. The rapid filling phase of the cardiac cycle - *FALSE* = E. The isovolumetric _relaxation_ phase of the cardiac cycle - TRUE
- The semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonic valves) are closed at the onset of the isovolumetric relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle. As the ventricles continue to relax and intraventricular pressures fall, a point is reached when the total energy of blood within the ventricles is less than the energy of blood in the outflow tracts. When this occurs, the pressure reversal causes the aortic and pulmonic valves to abruptly close (aortic precedes pulmonic), causing the second heart sound (S2). Valve closure is associated with a small backflow of blood into the ventricles and a characteristic notch (incisura or dicrotic notch) in the aortic and pulmonary artery pressure tracings.

### Q2.24
_Turbulence_ in a blood vessel is _more likely_ to occur if:

	A. The velocity of blood within the vessel increases
	B. The diameter of the vessel decreases
	C. The viscosity of blood within the vessel increases
	D. The density of blood decreases
	E. The length of the vessel increases
	
#### Answer: B. The diameter of the vessel decreases - *FALSE* = A. The velocity of blood within the vessel increases - TRUE
- The resistance to sliding flow between fluid layers can lead to irregular flow known as turbulence. The amount of turbulence in a fluid depends on the velocity and general characteristics of the fluid. If the layers of a fluid slide easily over each other, the fluid is said to exhibit laminar flow and has little turbulence. If the velocity is high enough, the local flow of the fluid may include circular currents that impede the sliding of the layers of the fluid. Reynold’s number is a quantity that serves as an indicator for the type of flow that a fluid will exhibit. This number, NR, depends on the viscosity η, the density ρ, the velocity v and the diameter D of the tube:
- Nr = (rho x v x D) / n
- Increasing the length of the vessel may indirectly decrease the likelihood of turbulence
	- By increasing vascular resistance and thus decreasing blood velocity

### Q2.25
The affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen will _increase_ if:

	A. Arterial PO2 is increased
	B. pH is decreased
	C. Blood temperature is increased
	D. H+ concentration is increased 
	E. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (PDG) levels in RBCs are decreased
	
#### Answer: A. Arterial PO2 is increased - *FALSE* = E. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (PDG) levels in RBCs are decreased - TRUE
- The oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve is capable of shifting to the right or the left. An increase in the blood PCO2 or hydrogen ion concentration [H+] (decreased pH) shifts the curve to the right, whereas a decrease in PCO2 or [H+] (increased pH) shifts the curve to the left. Shifts in the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve as a result of changes in the blood PCO2 or pH are termed the Bohr effect. An increase in blood temperature or 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels in the red blood cells (RBCs) also shifts the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve to the right, whereas a decrease in temperature or 2,3-DPG shifts the curve to the left. A shift in the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve to the right means that more O2 is liberated for a given decrease in the PO2.
- Stated another way, a shift in the curve to the right indicates that the affinity of haemoglobin for O2 is reduced, so that, for a given plasma PO2, more O2 is freed from the haemoglobin. In contrast, a shift in the curve to the left means that more O2 will be attached to haemoglobin (increased affinity) for a given PO2. Thus, less O2 is available to the tissues or is freed from haemoglobin at a given PO2.

### Q2.26
A patient with persistent diarrhoea will have an _increased_:

	A. Anion gap
	B. Filtered load of bicarbonate
	C. Production of ammonia by the distal tubule
	D. H+ secretion by the distal tubule
	E. Production of new bicarbonate by the proximal tubule
	
#### Answer: B. Filtered load of bicarbonate - *FALSE* = D. H+ secretion by the distal tubule - TRUE
- Persistent diarrhoea will result in metabolic acidosis (increase in the H+ concentration) as a result of the loss of bicarbonate-rich secretions from the pancreas and gallbladder. The response of the body to an increase in the H+ concentration involves several processes. The first and most readily available process is extracellular buffering. The most readily measured extracellular buffer is carbonic acid (H2CO3). This buffer is considered an open buffering system because compensatory mechanisms in respiratory carbon dioxide (CO2) (increase or decrease in ventilation) and renal HCO3– (increase or decrease in kidney reclamation of HCO3–) serve to maintain equilibrium. Metabolic acidosis most commonly stimulates the central and peripheral chemoreceptors that control respiration, resulting in an increase in alveolar ventilation, which in turn results in a compensatory respiratory alkalosis. As a result of buffering of H+ by HCO3– the plasma concentration of HCO3– will decrease, which will decrease the amount of HCO3– that is filtered in the proximal tubule. At the same time, the metabolic acidosis will increase ammonia production by the proximal tubule as well as H+ secretion and production of new bicarbonate by the distal nephron. As the metabolic acidosis is produced by the loss of bicarbonate, the anion gap will remain within normal limits.

### Q2.27
A patient in the ED with _profuse haemorrhage from a severed limb artery_ will have _increased_:

	A. Sodium excretion
	B. Sympathetic nerve activity
	C. Vagal nerve activity
	D. Arteriolar diameter in skin
	E. Water excretion
	
#### Answer: B. Sympathetic nerve activity - TRUE
- Haemorrhage is compensated for by several methods that are both acute and chronic fixes for the problem. Rapid compensation for low blood volume include vaso- and venoconstriction, increased heart rate (tachycardia), adrenergic output from the adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerves, secretion of vasopressin, glucocorticoids, renin, aldosterone and erythropoietin, and hepatic plasma protein synthesis. By decreasing urine formation, retaining sodium and water, increasing blood pressure, stimulation of blood cell formation and increasing plasma oncotic pressure, the net effect is to feed the brain and heart while restoring normal blood volume.

### Q2.28
Intestinal peristalsis results in the movement of food through the gut. Intestinal peristalsis:

	A. Is controlled by extrinsic innervation - F
	B. Is inhibited by vagotomy - F
	C. Is inhibited by sympathectomy - F
	D. Requires an intact myenteric nerve plexus
	E. Is inhibited by cholecystokinin - F	

#### Answer: D. Requires an intact myenteric nerve plexus - TRUE
- Peristalsis is a distinctive pattern of smooth muscle contractions that propels foodstuffs distally through the oesophagus and intestines. It was first described by Bayliss and Starling as a type of motility in which there is contraction above and relaxation below a segment that is being stimulated. Peristalsis is not affected to any degree by vagotomy or sympathectomy, indicating its mediation by the intestine’s local, intrinsic nervous system. Peristalsis is a manifestation of two major reflexes within the enteric nervous system that are stimulated by a bolus of foodstuff in the lumen. Mechanical distension and perhaps mucosal irritation stimulate afferent enteric neurons. 
- These sensory neurons synapse with two sets of cholinergic interneurons, which lead to two distinct effects:
	- One group of interneurons activates excitatory motor neurons above the bolus; these neurons, which contain acetylcholine and substance P, stimulate contraction of smooth muscle above the bolus.
	- Another group of interneurons activates inhibitory motor neurons that stimulate relaxation of smooth muscle below the bolus. These inhibitor neurons appear to use nitric oxide, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and ATP as neurotransmitters.

### Q2.29
Secretin was the first substance that was identified to cause a physiological effect in the body after being transported via the blood. Which of the following statements about secretin is true?

	A. It is a polypeptide hormone made up of 17 amino acids
	B. It increases gallbladder emptying
	C. It is released by the presence of long-chain fatty acids in the chyme
	D. It stimulates bicarbonate release from the pancreas
	E. It inhibits pepsinogen secretion

#### Answer: D. It stimulates bicarbonate release from the pancreas - TRUE
- Secretin is a peptide hormone made of 27 amino acids, produced in the crypts of lieberkühn of the duodenum and released in response to a luminal pH <4.5. It stimulates fluid and bicarbonate release from the pancreas and stimulates pepsinogen secretion.

### Q2.30
A 72-year-old woman developed an acute pulmonary embolism 3 days after her total hip replacement. Which of the following features is most likely to be seen in this patient?

	A. Increased PCO2
	B. Increased PO2
	C. Decreased alveolar dead space
	D. Decreased right ventricular afterload
	E. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance

#### Answer: E. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance - TRUE
- Acute respiratory consequences of pulmonary embolism include increased alveolar dead space, pneumoconstriction, hypoxaemia and hyperventilation, leading to low PCO2. Later, two additional consequences may occur: regional loss of surfactant and pulmonary infarction. Arterial hypoxaemia is a frequent but not universal finding in patients with acute embolism. The mechanisms of hypoxaemia include ventilation/perfusion mismatch, intrapulmonary shunts, reduced cardiac output and intracardiac shunt via a patent foramen ovale. Pulmonary infarction is an uncommon consequence because of the bronchial arterial collateral circulation. Pulmonary embolism reduces the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed, resulting in an increment in pulmonary vascular resistance, which, in turn, increases the right ventricular afterload. If the afterload is increased severely, right ventricular failure may ensue. In addition, the humoral and reflex mechanisms contribute to the pulmonary arterial constriction. Prior poor cardiopulmonary status of the patient is an important factor, leading to haemodynamic collapse.


Questions 2.31-2.40

70% - F: 31, 35, 39

### Q2.31
What will be the interstitial osmotic pressure in a skin capillary if fluid is being forced out of it with a net filtration pressure of 8 mmHg when the capillary hydrostatic pressure is 24 mmHg, interstitial hydrostatic pressure 7 mmHg and capillary osmotic pressure 17 mmHg? (_Assume that both the filtration coefficient and reflection coefficient in this case are 1_).

	A. 8 mmHg
	B. 6 mmHg
	C. 9 mmHg
	D. –9 mmHg
	E. -6 mmHg

#### Answer: B. 6 mmHg - *FALSE* = A. 8 mmHg - TRUE
- Starling’s hypothesis states that the fluid movement as a result of filtration across the wall of a capillary is dependent on the balance between the hydrostatic pressure gradient and the oncotic pressure gradient across the capillary. The four Starling’s forces are:
1.    Hydrostatic pressure in the capillary (Pc)
2.    Hydrostatic pressure in the interstitium (Pi)
3.    Oncotic pressure in the capillary (πc)
4.    Oncotic pressure in the interstitium (πi).
 
The balance of these forces allows calculation of the net driving pressure for filtration:
•    Net driving pressure = [(Pc – Pi) – (πc – πi)]
The net fluid flux is proportional to this net driving pressure. To derive an equation to measure this fluid flux several additional factors need to be considered, including:
•    The reflection coefficient
•    The filtration coefficient (Kf).
 
An additional point to note here is that the capillary hydrostatic pressure falls along the capillary from the arteriolar to the venous end and the driving pressure will decrease (and typically become negative) along the length of the capillary. The other Starling’s forces remain constant along the capillary.
The reflection coefficient can be thought of as a correction factor that is applied to the measured oncotic pressure gradient across the capillary wall. Consider the following. The small leakage of proteins across the capillary membrane has two important effects:
1.    The interstitial fluid oncotic pressure is higher then it would otherwise be.
2.    Not all of the protein present is effective in retaining water so the effective capillary oncotic pressure is lower than the measured oncotic pressure (in the same way that there is a difference between osmolality and tonicity).
 
Both these effects decrease the oncotic pressure gradient. The interstitial oncotic pressure is accounted for because its value is included in the calculation of the gradient.
The reflection coefficient is used to correct the magnitude of the measured gradient to take account of the ‘effective oncotic pressure’. It can have a value from 0 to 1. For example, CSF and the glomerular filtrate have very low protein concentrations and the reflection coefficient for protein in these capillaries is close to 1. Proteins cross the walls of the hepatic sinusoids relatively easily and the protein concentration of hepatic lymph is very high. The reflection coefficient for protein in the sinusoids is low. The reflection coefficient in the pulmonary capillaries is intermediate in value: about 0.5.
The net fluid flux (caused by filtration) across the capillary wall is proportional to the net driving pressure. The filtration coefficient is the constant of proportionality in the flux equation (Starling’s equation). The filtration coefficient consists of two components because the net fluid flux is dependent on:
1.    The area of the capillary walls where the transfer occurs
2.    The permeability of the capillary wall to water (this permeability factor is usually considered in terms of the ‘hydraulic conductivity’ of the wall).
 
The filtration coefficient is the product of these two components:
•    Kf = Area Hydraulic conductivity
•    A ‘leaky’ capillary (eg as a result of histamine) would have a high filtration coefficient. The glomerular capillaries are naturally very leaky because this is necessary for their function; they have a high filtration coefficient.
Now, using Starling’s equation:
Net fluid flux = Kf × (Net driving pressure)
Net fluid flux = Kf × [(Pc – Pi) – rc (πc – πi)] where rc is the reflection coefficient; substituting the values in the question into the
equation and solving for interstitial oncotic pressure (πi) we get:
8mmHg = 1 × [(24 – 7) –1 × (17 – πi)]
πi = 8mmHg

### Q2.32
When air enters the intrapleural space (*pneumothorax*), the most likely response is for:

	A. The lung to expand outwards and the chest wall to spring inwards
	B. The lung to expand outwards and the chest wall to spring outwards
	C. The lung to collapse inwards and the chest wall to collapse inwards
	D. The lung to collapse inwards and the chest wall to spring outwards
	E. The lung volume to be unaffected and chest wall to spring outwards
	
#### Answer: D. The lung to collapse inwards and the chest wall to spring outwards - TRUE
- Pneumothorax is the presence of air within the pleural space. Pneumothorax is considered to be one of the most common forms of thoracic disease and is classified as spontaneous (not caused by trauma), traumatic or iatrogenic. Entry of air into the pleural space results in collapse of the lung. The primary physical sign of pneumothorax is a decrease or absence of breath sounds despite normal or increased resonance on percussion. However, this may be difficult to detect, particularly in patients with a small pneumothorax or in those who have underlying emphysema. Patients with a small pneumothorax (involving <15% of the hemithorax) may have a normal physical examination. Tachycardia is the most common physical finding. Large pneumothoraces can cause decreased movement of the chest wall, a hyperresonant percussion note, diminished tactile focal fremitus and resonance, and decreased or absent breath sounds on the affected side. Haemodynamic instability, which is indicated by tachycardia, hypotension and cyanosis, suggests a tension pneumothorax. Arterial blood gases may reveal acute respiratory alkalosis and an increased alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient. Unusual clinical manifestations of pneumothorax include ptosis (as a result of extension of subcutaneous emphysema), pneumocephalus (secondary to tension pneumothorax associated with a comminuted fracture of the thoracic spine) and recurrent pneumopericardium (in association with a pleuropericardial defect).

### Q2.33
Haemodynamic changes in response to _obstruction of venous return_ to the _right side of the heart_ include:

	A. Cardiac output will fall and systemic arterial blood pressure will fall
	B. Cardiac output will rise and systemic arterial blood pressure will rise
	C. Cardiac output will fall and systemic arterial blood pressure will rise
	D. Cardiac output will fall and systemic arterial blood pressure will remain unchanged
	E. Cardiac output will remain unchanged and systemic arterial blood pressure will fall

#### Answer: C. Cardiac output will fall and systemic arterial blood pressure will rise - TRUE
- As a result of obstruction to venous return, the right atrial pressure falls, leading to a fall in left atrial pressure, which in turn results in a decreased preload on the left ventricle. This decrease in preload lowers cardiac output. The fall in cardiac output is compensated for by an increase in total peripheral resistance, a rise in systemic arterial blood pressure, a fall in the urine production and a rise in the heart rate.

### Q2.34
Common features of a _tumour of the right atrium_ and _cardiac tamponade_ include:

	A. Pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary venous congestion
	B. Pulmonary venous congestion, systemic venous congestion and systemic hypotension
	C. Systemic oedema, high cardiac output and ascites
	D. Systemic oedema, congestion of the systemic veins and ascites
	E. Pulmonary oedema, systemic hypertension and low cardiac output

#### Answer: D. Systemic oedema, congestion of the systemic veins and ascites - TRUE
- Each of these stresses involves obstruction of blood flow into the right atrium. The excess blood in the circulation is pooled in the venous system resulting in engorged veins. Urine production falls, exacerbating the patient’s illness. The increase in intravascular pressure causes fluid to be filtered out of the circulation and into the extravascular space, leading to systemic oedema and ascites.

### Q2.35
Voltage-gated sodium channels are an example of a protein embedded in the plasma membrane of nerve and muscle cells that is used in the rapid electrical signalling found in these cells. _Voltage-gated sodium channels_:
	
	A. Are formed by co-assembly of five identical or similar subunits
	B. Have specialised transmembrane domains (S4) that sense transmembrane voltage
	C. Are equally permeable to K+ and Na+
	D. Are activated by binding of glycine
	E. Are activated by a decrease in intracellular ATP concentration
	
#### Answer: E. Are activated by a decrease in intracellular ATP concentration - *FALSE* = B. Have specialised transmembrane domains (S4) that sense transmembrane voltage - TRUE
- Voltage-gated sodium channels are crucial for the propagation of action potentials in excitable membranes. They cause the cell membrane to depolarise by allowing the influx of Na+ into the cell. They have been known to cause this effect for almost half a century. Some 7000 sodium ions pass through each channel during the brief period (about 1 ms) that it remains open. Voltage-gated Na+ channels consist of an subunit responsible for selectivity and voltage gating. However, some sodium channels also have one or two smaller subunits called β-1 and β-2. The protein has four homologous domains containing multiple potential α-helical transmembrane segments. The segments are connected by non-conserved, hydrophilic, intervening segments. The fourth transmembrane segment (S4) of each domain is highly positively charged and thought to be a voltage sensor.

### Q2.36
Cells with in the sinoatrial (SA) node are the primary pacemaker site within the heart. These cells are characterised as having no true resting potential, but instead generate regular, spontaneous action potentials. Phase O of an SA nodal action potential results from:

	A. Activation of sodium channels
	B. Activation of the pacemaker current
	C. Influx of Ca2+ ions
	D. Inactivation of K+ channels
	E. Influx of Na+ ions
	
#### Answer: C. Influx of Ca2+ ions - TRUE
- Cells within the sinoatrial (SA) node are the primary pacemaker site within the heart. These cells are characterised as having no true resting potential, but instead generate regular, spontaneous action potentials. Unlike most other cells that elicit action potentials (eg nerve cells, muscle cells), the depolarising current is carried primarily by relatively slow, inward Ca2+ currents instead of by fast Na+ currents. There are, in fact, no fast Na+ currents operating in SA nodal cells.
- Phase 0 depolarisation is primarily a result of increased Ca2+ conductance. As a result of the movement (or conductance) of Ca2+ through their channels not being rapid (hence, the term ‘slow inward Ca2+ channels’), the rate of depolarisation (slope of phase 0) is much slower than found in other cardiac cells (eg Purkinje cells).

### Q2.37
What should the myeloid:erythroid ratio in your bone marrow be if you want to be a _voluntary bone marrow donor_?

	A. 1:1
	B. 1:3
	C. 3:1
	D. 1:10
	E. 10.1
	
#### Answer: C. 3:1 - TRUE
- The normal bone marrow examination findings include:
	- Fat:cell ratio
	- Child aged <10 years: 10% fat:90% cells
	- Adult: 30–70% fat:70–30% cells
	- **Myeloid:erythroid ratio: 3:1**
	- Erythroid cells: 18–39% of marrow nucleated cells
	- Megakaryocytes: 0.5–2% of nucleated cells in marrow
	- Lymphocytes: 11–23% of nucleated cells in marrow
	- T lymphocytes: B lymphocytes = 3:1
	- Plasma cells: 0.4–3.9% of nucleated cells in marrow
	- Myeloid cells: 60–75% of nucleated cells in marrow
	- Neutrophilic series: 49–65%
	- Eosinophilic series: 1.2–5.3%
	- Basophilic series and mast cells: <0.2%.

### Q2.38
Substances with high oil:water partition coefficients readily permeate cell membranes. Which group has high oil:water partition coefficients?

	A. Peptides, steroid hormones, oxygen
	B. Steroid hormones, oxygen, ions
	C. Oxygen, ions, carbon dioxide
	D. Ions, carbon dioxide, steroid hormones
	E. Carbon dioxide, steroid hormones, oxygen
		
#### Answer: E. Carbon dioxide, steroid hormones, oxygen - TRUE
- The oil/water partition coefficient (β) is obtained by:
	- [Solute]oil/[Solute]water after dissolving it in a 50:50 oil:water mix
- Lipid-soluble compounds (hydrophobic) have high partition coefficients; water-soluble compounds have low partition coefficients.
- Molecules with a large β value have a greater effective transmembrane solute gradient for a given concentration difference between the extracellular fluid and cytoplasm
Molecules with a small β value have a lower effective transmembrane solute gradient
- Carbon dioxide, steroid hormones and oxygen have high coefficients and readily permeate cell membranes

### Q2.39
_Stroke volume_ is the amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle of the heart in one contraction. Which of the following statements about stroke volume is true?

	A. It is the difference between the ventricular end-systolic volume and ventricular end-diastolic volume - F
	B. It is normally 120ml in an adult weighing 70kg - F
	C. It is decreased by sympathetic activation of the heart
	D. It is increased by increased venous return
	E. It is increased by systemic hypertension - F

#### Answer: A. It is the difference between the ventricular end-systolic volume and ventricular end-diastolic volume - *FALSE* = D. It is increased by increased venous return - TRUE
- Ventricular stroke volume (SV) is the difference between the ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV) and the end-systolic volume (ESV). In a typical adult heart, the EDV is about 120ml blood and the ESV about 50ml blood. The difference in these two volumes, 70ml, represents the SV
- Therefore, any factor that alters either the EDV or the ESV will change the SV:
	- SV = EDV – ESV
- There are three primary mechanisms that regulate EDV and ESV, and therefore SV. SV is regulated is by the Frank–Starling mechanism. Briefly, an increase in preload exemplified by an increase in venous return to the heart increases the ventricular EDV and the force of ventricular contraction, which enables the heart to eject the additional blood that was returned to it. Conversely, a decrease in venous return leads to a decrease in SV by this mechanism. Changes in afterload affect the ability of the ventricle to eject blood and thereby alter ESV and SV. For example, an increase in afterload (eg increased aortic pressure) decreases SV by increasing ESV. Conversely, a decrease in afterload augments SV. Changes in inotropy (contractility) alter the rate of ventricular pressure development thereby affecting ESV and SV. For example, an increase in inotropy (eg sympathetic activation of the heart) decreases ESV and increases SV. Conversely, a decrease in inotropy (eg heart failure) reduces SV by increasing ESV.

### Q2.40
Which of the following statements about electrolyte concentration of body fluids is correct?

	A. Plasma has 20 mmol/L Mg2
	B. Interstitial fluid has 10 mmol/L Cl
	C. Intracellular fluid has 30 mmol/L HCO3
	D. Plasma has 2.5 mmol/L SO4 
	E. Intracellular fluid has 150 mmol/L K+

#### Answer: E. Intracellular fluid has 150 mmol/L K+ - TRUE
- Electrolyte concentration of body fluids

##### Cations (mmol/L)

Electrolyte	| Plasma	| Interstitial	| Intracellular	|
------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
Na			| 142		| 144			|  10

Questions 2.41-2.50
-------------------

50% - F: 41, 42, 47, 49, 50

### Q2.41
A patient in ED is noted to have _metabolic acidosis_ with a _normal anion gap_. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be associated with this abnormality?

	A. Renal failure
	B. Rhabdomyolysis
	C. Lactic acidosis
	D. Alcoholic ketoacidosis
	E. Ureterosigmoidostomy

#### Answer: B. Rhabdomyolysis - *FALSE* = E. Ureterosigmoidostomy - TRUE
- Metabolic acidosis results from the accumulation of non-volatile acids, reduction of renal acid excretion or loss of alkali. Anion gap (normal 3–11mmol/L) represents those anions, other than Cl– and HCO3–, necessary to counterbalance Na+ electrically:
	- Anion gap (AG) (mmol/L) = Na+ (mmol/L) – Cl– (mmol/L) + HCO3– (mmol/L).
- A normal anion gap (hyperchloraemic) metabolic acidosis results from the loss of bicarbonate-rich fluids from the GI tract (eg diarrhoea or pancreatic or biliary fistula) or kidney (eg renal tubular acidosis, K+– sparing diuretics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors). It may also occur after the administration of HCl or its precursor (eg in parenteral nutrition) and ureterosigmoidostomy. Increased AG metabolic acidosis occurs in the setting of toxic ingestions (eg salicylates, methanol, ethylene glycol), rhabdomyolysis, overproduction of endogenous acids (eg lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis) or as a consequence of renal failure. Lactic acidosis (normal serum lactate 0.3–1.3mmol/L) represents one of the most common causes of severe metabolic acidosis encountered in the critically ill surgical patient.

### Q2.42
A patient on the surgical ward is noted to have _metabolic alkalosis_ with a urine [Cl] of <15 mmol/L. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be associated with this abnormality?
 
	A. Nasogastric suctioning
	B. Mineralocorticoid excess
	C. Alkali loading
	D. Concurrent diuretic administration
	E. Severe hyPOkalaemia

#### Answer: C. Alkali loading - *FALSE* = A. Nasogastric suctioning - TRUE
- Although cause of metabolic alkalosis is usually apparent in surgical patient
	- Measurement of urinary Cl– concentration may be useful in differentiating disorders
- Urine Cl– concentration < 15 mmol/L suggests the following causes of Metabolic Alkalosis
	- Vomiting
	- Nasogastric suctioning
	- Post-diuretic administration
	- Post-hypercapnia
- Urine Cl– concentration > 20 mmol/L suggests 
	- Mineralocorticoid excess
	- Alkali loading
	- Concurrent diuretic administration
	- Presence of severe hyPOkalaemia

### Q2.43
The ejection fraction is a measurement of the heart's efficiency and can be used to estimate the function of the left ventricle, which pumps blood to the rest of the body. In a resting healthy individual the ejection fraction is:

	A. 20%
	B. 30%
	C. 45%
	D. >60%
	E. 90%
	
#### Answer: D. >60% - TRUE
- Ejection fraction (EF) is fraction of blood ejected by ventricle relative to its end-diastolic volume
	- Therefore, EF is calculated from: EF = (SV/EDV) × 100
	- where SV is the stroke volume and EDV is the end-diastolic volume
- EF is most commonly measured using echocardiography
	- This noninvasive technique provides good estimates of EDV, ESV and SV (SV = EDV – ESV)
- Normally, EF is >60%. For example, if the SV is 75ml and the EDV 120ml, then the EF is 63%. During exercise in highly conditioned individuals, the increased SV (caused primarily by increased inotropy) can result in the EF exceeding 90%. In heart failure, particularly in dilated cardiomyopathy, the EF can become very small as the SV decreases and EDV increases. In severe heart failure, the EF may be only 20%. The EF is often used as a clinical index to evaluate the inotropic status of the heart. However, it is important to note that there are circumstances in which the EF can be normal, yet the ventricle is in failure. One example is diastolic dysfunction caused by hypertrophy, in which filling is impaired because of low ventricular compliance and SV is therefore reduced.

### Q2.44
A 42-yo woman with small cell carcinoma of her left lung was noticed to have the following biochemical abnormalities:

Name              | Value         | Status				|
------------------|--------------:|------
Serum Na          | 125 mmol/L    | LOW = HyPOnatraemia
Plasma Osmolality | 250 mosmol/kg | LOW = HyPOtonicity           
Urine Osmolality  | 150 mosmol/kg | HIGH = Concentrated Urine           
Urine Na          |  30 mmol/L    | HIGH = Elevated Urine Na

Excess of which of the following hormones is responsible for this abnormal biochemical profile?

	A. Thyroxine
	B. Oxycontin
	C. Cortisol
	D. Adrenaline (epinephrine)
	E. Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH)

#### Answer: E. Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) - TRUE
- This patient has got excess ADH (vasopressin) release, resulting in the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH). Ordinarily, release of ADH from the posterior pituitary gland occurs as a physiological response to a drop in plasma volume or an increase in serum osmolality. Non-osmotically driven secretion of ADH in the absence of a haemodynamic disturbance characterises SIADH. 
- Specific diagnostic criteria that define SIADH include the following:
	- HyPOnatraemia (serum Na+ <135mmol/L)
	- HyPOtonicity (plasma osmolality <280 mosmol/kg)
	- Inappropriately concentrated urine (>100 mosmol/kg water)
	- Elevated urine Na+ concentration (>20mmol/L), except during Na+ restriction
	- Clinical euvolaemia
	- Normal renal, adrenal and thyroid function
- Sodium serves as the major determinant of serum osmolality and reflects the relative ratio of Na+:H2O in the blood. ADH, a water-retaining hormone, promotes water retention by increasing the permeability of nephrons. Elevation in the ADH level despite low serum Na+ levels and decreased osmolality indicates the presence of a non-osmotic stimulus for ADH release. Excess ADH may emerge from the pituitary gland or an ectopic source, such as neoplasms and/or pulmonary tissue.
- Neoplastic cells obtained from tumours of patients with SIADH are characterised by the potential to synthesise, store and secrete ADH (eg increased levels of ADH found in about 60% of patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung). Even though hyponatraemia accompanying SIADH arises from an increase in total body water, this condition is sometimes referred to, confusingly, as a cause of euvolaemic hyponatraemia. Patients with SIADH demonstrate relatively normal Na+ excretion (if intake is normal), high urine osmolality and only subtle evidence of volume expansion.
- As most excess body water accumulates intracellularly and not in the intravascular space, evidence of oedema, ascites and heart failure is absent. However, intracellular oedema alters cell functions, with the central nervous system being the most sensitive to these changes.

### Q2.45
A 65-yo woman was admitted with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Her ABG on room air showed:

Name  |      Value	| Range		|
------|------------:|----------:|
pH    | 7.29		| ?
PaCO2 | 8.5kPa		| ?
PaO2  | 8.0kPa		| ?
HCO3  | 30.5 mmol/L	| ?

What is the acid-base disturbance?

	A. Metabolic acidosis
	B. Respiratory acidosis
	C. Metabolic alkalosis
	D. Respiratory alkalosis
	E. Compensated metabolic acidosis

#### Answer: B. Respiratory acidosis - TRUE
- This patient had respiratory acidosis as the Paco2 is high and standard bicarbonate is slightly elevated. This is a common finding in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Respiratory acidosis is a clinical disturbance that is due to alveolar hypoventilation. Production of carbon dioxide occurs rapidly, and failure of ventilation promptly increases the partial arterial pressure of carbon dioxide (Paco2). The reference range for Paco2 is 36–44mmHg (4.4–5.9kPa). Alveolar hypoventilation leads to an increased Paco2 (ie, hypercapnia). The increase in Paco2 in turn decreases the HCO3–/Paco2 and decreases pH. Hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis occur when impairment in ventilation occurs and the removal of CO2 by the lungs is less than the production of CO2 in the tissues. In acute respiratory acidosis, compensation occurs in two steps. The initial response is cellular buffering that occurs over minutes to hours. Cellular buffering elevates plasma bicarbonate (HCO3–) only slightly, approximately 1 mEq/L (1mmol/L) for each 10mmHg (1.33kPa) increase in Paco2. The second step is renal compensation that occurs over 3–5 days. With renal compensation, renal excretion of carbonic acid is increased and bicarbonate reabsorption is increased. In renal compensation, plasma bicarbonate rises 3.5 mEq/L (3.5mmol/L) for each increase of 10mmHg (1.33kPa) in Paco2. 

- The expected change in serum bicarbonate concentration in respiratory acidosis can be estimated as follows:
	- Acute respiratory acidosis: HCO3– increases 1 mEq/L (1mmol/L) for each 10mmHg (1.33kPa) rise in PaCO2
	- Chronic respiratory acidosis: HCO3– rises 3.5 mEq/L (3.5mmol/L) for each 10mmHg (1.33kPa) rise in PaCO2
- The expected change in pH with respiratory acidosis can be estimated with the following equations:
	- Acute respiratory acidosis: Change in pH: 0.008 × (40 – Paco2)
	- Chronic respiratory acidosis: change in pH: 0.003 × (40 – Paco2)
 
- Respiratory acidosis does not have a great effect on electrolyte levels. Some small effects occur on calcium and potassium levels. Acidosis decreases binding of calcium to albumin and tends to increase serum ionized calcium levels. In addition, acidaemia causes an extracellular shift of potassium, but respiratory acidosis rarely causes clinically significant hyperkalaemia.

### Q2.46
The following values were obtained from a Swan-Ganz catheter in a patient who was admitted to an ICU with low cardiac output (CO) after myocardial infarction (MI)

Measurement                            | Value		|
---------------------------------------|-----------:|
Cardiac output (CO)                    | 2.0L/min
Mean arterial pressure MAP             | 50 mmHg
Central venous pressure (CVP)          | 14 mmHg
Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) | 16 mmHg
Mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP)  | 35 mmHg

	A.  800 dyn/cm^2
	B. 1000 dyn/cm^2
	C. 1440 dyn/cm^2
	D. 1500 dyn/cm^2
	E. 1620 dyn/cm^2

#### Answer: C. 1440 dyn/cm^2 - TRUE
- The flow-directed balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter (also known as the Swan–Ganz catheter) has been in clinical use for almost 30 years. Initially developed for the management of acute myocardial infarction, it now has widespread use in the management of a variety of critical illnesses and surgical procedures. It is used for estimation of pressure in the right atrium (central venous pressure or CVP), right ventricle and pulmonary artery, and of pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP). Other important information provided by a Swan–Ganz catheter includes the cardiac output (CO), mixed venous oxygen saturation Svo2 and oxygen saturations in the right heart chambers to assess for the presence of an intracardiac shunt. Using these measurements, other variables can be derived, including pulmonary or systemic vascular resistance and the difference between arterial and venous oxygen content.
- Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) can be calculated by using the following formula:
	- SVR = (MAP – CVP/CO) × 80, where MAP is mean arterial pressure
- Thus, substituting the values in this equation, the SVR for this patient is 1440 dyn/cm2

### Q2.47
A Swan-Hanz catheter inserted into a patient with low cardiac output records a pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) of 18 mmHg. The same pressure would be expected in which of the following structures.

	A. Systemic veins
	B. Right ventricle
	C. Left ventricle
	D. Aorta
	E. Left atrium

#### Answer: B. Right ventricle - *FALSE* = E. Left atrium - TRUE
- The measurement of the PAWP, also known as the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), provides an indirect measure of left atrial pressure and is particularly useful in the diagnosis of left ventricular failure and mitral stenosis. The measurement is made as follows. A balloon-tipped, multi-lumen (Swan–Ganz) catheter is advanced from a peripheral vein into the right atrium and right ventricle and then positioned within a branch of the pulmonary artery. There is one opening (port) at the tip of the catheter (distal to the balloon) and a second port several centimetres proximal to the balloon. These ports are connected to pressure transducers. When properly positioned in a branch of the pulmonary artery, the distal port measures pulmonary artery pressure (about 30/15mmHg) and the proximal port measures right atrial pressure (about 0–2mmHg). The balloon is then inflated with air using a syringe (the balloon volume is about 1ml) which occludes the branch of the pulmonary artery. When this occurs, the pressure in the distal port rapidly falls and, after about 10 seconds, reaches a stable lower value that is very similar to left atrial pressure (normally about 8–10mmHg). The balloon is then deflated. The recorded pressure during balloon inflation is similar to the left atrial pressure because the occluded vessel, along with its distal branches that eventually form the pulmonary veins, acts as a long catheter that measures the blood pressures within the pulmonary veins (this pressure is virtually the same as mean left atrial pressure). A PAWP exceeding 15mmHg suggests mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, severe aortic stenosis or left ventricular failure. When the PAWP exceeds 20mmHg, the transmission of this pressure back into the pulmonary vasculature increases pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure, which can lead to pulmonary congestion and oedema.

### Q2.48
A 40-yo man is on injectable vitamin B12 replacement therapy after a gastrectomy for a tumour involving the gastric fundus. Absence of which of the following cell types is responsible for this vitamin replacement requirement

	A. Parietal cells
	B. Chief cells
	C. G-cells
	D. Mucus neck cells
	E. Goblet cells

#### Answer: A. Parietal cells - TRUE
- The parietal cells of the stomach produce intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein that forms a complex with dietary vitamin B12. The stimulus for production can be either vagal, gastrin or histamine signals. The ileum has specific receptors on its enterocytes for the complex. In the presence of calcium ions and a low pH, vitamin B12 is then taken up by the cell and intrinsic factor is re-released into the gut. Patients without a stomach and those with pernicious anaemia require injectable vitamin B12 replacement therapy. Parietal cells also synthesise and secrete hydrochloric acid. Chief cells secrete pepsinogen, the proenzyme form of pepsin. G-cells secrete gastrin, which stimulates secretion of acid by parietal cells found in the body and fundus of the stomach. Goblet cells are part of the mucosa of the small intestine, not the stomach. Mucus neck cells secrete mucus and are located in the necks of the gastric glands.

### Q2.49
Release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland occurs as a physiological response to a _drop in plasma volume_ or an _increase in serum osmolality_. In the _presence of ADH_ the glomerular filtrate will be isotonic to plasma in:

	A. The ascending limb of the loop of Henle
	B. The cortical collecting tubule
	C. The medullary collecting tubule
	D. The descending limb of the loop of Henle
	E. The renal pelvis	
#### Answer: D. The descending limb of the loop of Henle - *FALSE* = B. The cortical collecting tubule - TRUE
- ADH increases the water permeability of the cortical and medullary collecting tubules and ducts, and allows the filtrate to reach osmotic equilibrium with the interstitial fluid surrounding the nephron. The interstitial fluid in the cortex of the kidney is isotonic to plasma, and therefore the filtrate can become isotonic to plasma in the cortical collecting tubule. The interstitial fluid is hypertonic to plasma in the medullary collecting tubule, and so the filtrate becomes hypertonic to plasma in this region of the nephron and remains hypertonic as it passes through the renal pelvis. ADH has no effect on the water permeability of the loop of Henle. The filtrate is hypertonic to plasma in the descending limb and becomes hypotonic to plasma by the time it reaches the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

### Q2.50
A 23-yo man arrived in the ED in shock with profuse bleeding from his femoral vessels after a gun shot injury to his right groin. Which of the following changes is most likely to be anticipated in this patient?

	A. Decreased release of thromboxane A2 at the site of injury
	B. Increased baseline vagal tone
	C. Dilatation of veins and venous reservoirs
	D. Increased renin secretion from the juxtaglomerular apparatus
	E. Decreased level of circulating ADH

#### Answer: B. Increased baseline vagal tone - *FALSE* = D. Increased renin secretion from the juxtaglomerular apparatus - TRUE
- The patient in this clinical scenario is in haemorrhagic shock as a result of acute external blood loss. The human body responds to acute haemorrhage by activating four major physiological systems: the haematological, cardiovascular, renal and neuroendocrine systems.
- The haematological system responds to an acute severe blood loss by activating the coagulation cascade and contracting the bleeding vessels (by means of local thromboxane A2 release). In addition, platelets are activated (also by means of local thromboxane A2 release) and form an immature clot on the bleeding source. The damaged vessel exposes collagen, which subsequently causes fibrin deposition and stabilisation of the clot. About 24 h are needed for complete clot fibrination and mature formation.
- The cardiovascular system initially responds to hypovolaemic shock by increasing the heart rate, increasing myocardial contractility and constricting peripheral blood vessels. This response occurs secondary to an increased release of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and decreased baseline vagal tone (regulated by the baroreceptors in the carotid arch, aortic arch, left atrium and pulmonary vessels). The cardiovascular system also responds by redistributing blood to the brain, heart and kidneys and away from the skin, muscle and GI tract.
- The renal system responds to haemorrhagic shock by stimulating an increase in renin secretion from the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which subsequently is converted to angiotensin II by the lungs and liver. Angiotensin II has two main effects, both of which help to reverse haemorrhagic shock: vasoconstriction of arteriolar smooth muscle and stimulation of aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone is responsible for active sodium reabsorption and subsequent water conservation.
- The neuroendocrine system responds to haemorrhagic shock by causing an increase in circulating ADH. ADH is released from the posterior pituitary gland in response to a decrease in blood pressure (as detected by baroreceptors) and a decrease in the sodium concentration (as detected by osmoreceptors). ADH indirectly leads to an increased reabsorption of water and sodium by the distal tubule, collecting ducts and loop of Henle.


Questions 2.51-2.60

70% = F: 53, 56, 57

### Q2.51
A 16-yo girl admitted with mitral stenosis (MS) caused by rheumatic heart disease. A rise in which of the following parameters is consistent with this patient's valvular lesion?

	A. Aortic pressure
	B. Cardiac output (CO)
	C. Left atrial pressure
	D. Left ventricular end-systolic volume (LV-ESV)
	E. Central venous pressure (CVP)	

#### Answer: C. Left atrial pressure - TRUE
- Mitral stenosis is a narrowing of the inlet valve into the left ventricle that prevents proper opening during diastolic filling. Patients with mitral stenosis typically have mitral valve leaflets that are thickened, commissures that are fused and/or chordae tendineae that are thickened and shortened. The most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic fever. About 40% of patients with rheumatic heart disease have isolated mitral stenosis. The normal area of the mitral valve orifice is 4–6cm2, which effectively creates a common chamber between the left atrium and the left ventricle in diastole. In early diastole, a small and brief pressure gradient is present, but, during most of the filling period, the pressures in the two chambers are equal. Narrowing of the valve area to less than 2.5cm2 impedes the free flow of blood and causes a build-up of left atrial pressure (LAP) to promote normal transmitral flow volume.
- Critical mitral stenosis occurs when the opening is reduced to 1cm2. At this stage, an LAP of 25mmHg is required to maintain a normal cardiac output. With progressive stenosis, critical flow restriction reduces left ventricular output. The increase in LAP also enlarges the left atrium and raises pulmonary venous and capillary pressures. The resulting pulmonary congestion and reduced cardiac output can mimic primary left ventricular failure, but left ventricular contractility is normal in most cases of mitral stenosis. As the disease evolves, chronic elevation of LAP eventually leads to pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid and pulmonary valve incompetence, and secondary right heart failure.

### Q2.52
You are looking at an ECG strip that show Sinus Bradycardia. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be associated with this ECG finding?

	A. Hypovolaemia
	B. Hypothermia
	C. Vasodilator therapy
	D. Injection of atropine
	E. Fever

#### Answer: B. Hypothermia - TRUE
- Sinus bradycardia can be defined as a sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of 60 beats/min or less. However, few patients actually become symptomatic until their heart rate drops to less than 50 beats/min. The action potential responsible for this rhythm arises from the sinus node and causes a P wave on the surface ECG that is normal in terms of both amplitude and vector. These P waves are typically followed by a normal QRS complex and T wave.
- Commonly, sinus bradycardia is an incidental finding in otherwise healthy individuals, particularly in athletes and young adults or sleeping patients. Apart from fit, but otherwise normal, individuals, there is a long list of situations where sinus bradycardia occurs, including:
	- Hypothermia
	- Increased vagal tone (as a result of vagal stimulation or drugs)
	- Hypothyroidism
	- β Blockade
	- Marked intracranial hypertension
	- Obstructive jaundice, and even in uraemia
	- Structural SA node disease or ischaemia
	- Sleep apnoea
	- Hypoglycaemia
	- Inferior wall myocardial infarction.

### Q2.53
A 48-yo woman presents to her doctor complaining of weakness and fatigue. On physical examination, her weight is up by 10 pounds (4.5 kg) compared with her last visit 6/12 ago. 

Name        | Value			| Range		|
------------|--------------:|----------:|
BP          | 160/100 mmHg	| 120/80

Serum K     | 2.8 mmol/L	| 3.0-3.5	
Serum Renin | DECREASED		| --

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

	A. Cushing’s syndrome
	B. Diabetes mellitus
	C. Phaeochromocytoma
	D. Primary aldosteronism
	E. Secondary aldosteronism

#### Answer: A. Cushing’s syndrome - *FALSE* = D. Primary aldosteronism - TRUE
- Primary aldosteronism (Conn’s syndrome) is a condition of hyperaldosteronism originating in the adrenal gland. The causes include an aldosterone-secreting adrenocortical adenoma, hyperplasia of the zona glomerulosa and, very rarely, an adrenal carcinoma. It is characterised by hypertension secondary to sodium retention, hypokalaemia and a decreased serum renin caused by a negative feedback of increased blood pressure on renin secretion.
- Cushing’s syndrome is the result of increased glucocorticoid production, particularly cortisol. Physical signs typically include ‘moon facies,’ truncal obesity, ‘buffalo hump’ and purple abdominal striae. Diabetes mellitus is a condition of inadequate insulin production that presents with hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis. Phaeochromocytoma is a rare tumour of chromaffin cells occurring most commonly in the adrenal medulla. The tumour secretes adrenaline and noradrenaline, resulting in secondary hypertension. Secondary aldosteronism results from an activation of the renin–angiotensin system caused by renal ischaemia, oedema and renal tumours. In contrast to primary aldosteronism, secondary aldosteronism is associated with increased serum renin.

### Q2.54
A patient is given an IV infusion of p-aminohippuric acid (PAH). After a short time:

Name       | Value		|
-----------|-----------:|
Plasma PAH | 0.02 mg/mL
Urine PAH  | 13 mg/mL
Urine flow | 1.0 mL/min

What is the effective renal plasma flow?

	A. 0.26 mL/min
	B. 26 mL/min
	C. 65 mL/min
	D. 260 mL/min
	E. 650 mL/min

#### Answer: E. 650 mL/min - TRUE
- renal plasma = 13/0.02 x 1.0 = 130/0.2 = 1300/2 = 650 mL/min
- Renal plasma flow can be determined by the principle of conservation and the use of a substance that is not synthesised or metabolised by the kidney. The amount of such a substance entering the kidney per unit time via the renal artery equals the amount leaving via the ureter and the renal vein. The difficulty of obtaining renal venous plasma samples limits the usefulness of this approach to measuring renal plasma flow. However, it has been found that the tubular secretory system for p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) is so efficient that at low plasma concentrations it removes 90% or more of the PAH from the plasma as it flows through the kidney. 
- Thus, for practical reasons, the 10% that remains in the renal vein is ignored and it is assumed that the amount entering the kidneys (renal plasma flow [RPF] × arterial concentration [PPAH]) equals the amount leaving via the ureters:
	- Urine concentration (UPAH) × Urine flow rate [V, ml/min], ie
		- RPF × PPAH = UPAH × V, and
		- RPF = UPAH × V/PPAH
- So, in this patient, substituting appropriate values, we have (13mg/ml × 1.0ml/min)/0.02mg/ml = 650ml/min.

### Q2.55
A 55-yo obese woman experience episodic abdominal pain. She notes that the _pain increases after the ingestion of a fatty meal_. The action of which of the following hormones is responsible for _intensification of her symptoms_.

	A. Cholecystokinin
	B. Gastrin
	C. Pepsin
	D. Secretin
	E. Somatostatin

#### Answer: A. Cholecystokinin - TRUE
- This woman has a risk profile (female, fat, 40s) and symptomatology consistent with gallstones (cholelithiasis). As would be expected, contraction of the gallbladder after a fatty meal often exacerbates the pain caused by gallstones. Cholecystokinin, the release of which is stimulated by dietary fat, is the hormone responsible for stimulation of gallbladder contraction. It is produced in I-cells of the duodenum and jejunum. In addition to gallbladder contraction, cholecystokinin also stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion and decreases the rate of gastric emptying.
- Gastrin is produced by the G-cells of the antrum and duodenum. Gastrin stimulates the secretion of HCl from the parietal cells and pepsinogen from the chief cells of the stomach. Gastrin secretion is stimulated by gastric distension, digestive products (eg amino acids) and vagal discharge. Pepsin is a protease produced by the chief cells of the stomach (as pepsinogen). It is involved in the digestion of proteins. Pepsinogen release is stimulated by vagal stimulation, gastrin, local acid production, secretin, cholecystokinin and histamine. Secretin is produced by the S-cells of the duodenum. It is secreted primarily in response to acidification of the duodenal mucosa. Secretin stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate-containing fluid from the pancreas and biliary ducts. This neutralisation allows pancreatic enzymes to function. Secretin also inhibits gastric acid production and gastric emptying. Somatostatin is produced by the D-cells of the pancreatic islets and in the gastric and intestinal mucosa. Somatostatin is an inhibitory hormone; it inhibits the secretion of most gastrointestinal hormones, gallbladder contraction, gastric acid and pepsinogen secretion, pancreatic and small intestinal fluid secretion and both glucagon and insulin release.

### Q2.56
Bile is a complex fluid containing water, electrolytes, and a battery of organic molecules including bile acids, cholesterol, phospholipids and bilirubin, which flows through the biliary tract into the small intestine. Which of the following statements about bile is true?

	A. Adult humans produce about 150–200ml of bile daily - F
	B. Bile acids are derivatives of cholesterol synthesised in the hepatocytes
	C. Hepatocytes add bicarbonate to the bile
	D. Bile salts are purely hydrophobic - F
	E. Of the bile acids delivered to the duodenum 5% are absorbed back into the blood within the ileum
	
#### Answer: E. Of the bile acids delivered to the duodenum 5% are absorbed back into the blood within the ileum - *FALSE* = B. Bile acids are derivatives of cholesterol synthesised in the hepatocytes - TRUE
- Adult humans produce 400–800ml of bile daily
- Secretion of bile can be considered to occur in two stages:
	1. Initially, hepatocytes secrete bile into canaliculi, from which it flows into bile ducts. This hepatic bile contains large quantities of bile acids, cholesterol and other organic molecules.
	2. As bile flows through the bile ducts it is modified by addition of a watery, bicarbonate-rich secretion from ductal epithelial cells.
 
- Bile acids are derivatives of cholesterol synthesised in the hepatocyte. Cholesterol, ingested as part of the diet or derived from hepatic synthesis, is converted into the bile acids cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids, which are then conjugated to an amino acid (glycine or taurine) to yield the conjugated form that is actively secreted into the canaliculi. Bile acids are facial amphipathic, ie they contain both hydrophobic (lipid soluble) and polar (hydrophilic) faces. The cholesterol-derived portion of a bile acid has one face that is hydrophobic (the one with methyl groups) and one that is hydrophilic (the one with the hydroxyl groups); the amino acid conjugate is polar and hydrophilic. Their amphipathic nature enables bile acids to emulsify lipid aggregates. Bile acids have detergent action on particles of dietary fat, which causes fat globules to break down or be emulsified into minute, microscopic droplets. Emulsification is not digestion as such, but is of importance because it greatly increases the surface area of fat, making it available for digestion by lipases, which cannot access the inside of lipid droplets.
- Bile acids are also lipid carriers and are able to solubilise many lipids by forming micelles – aggregates of lipids such as fatty acids, cholesterol and monoglycerides – that remain suspended in water. Bile acids are also critical for transport and absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins. Large amounts of bile acids are secreted into the intestine every day, but only relatively small quantities are lost from the body. This is because about 95% of the bile acids delivered to the duodenum are absorbed back into the blood within the ileum. Venous blood from the ileum goes straight into the portal vein, and hence through the sinusoids of the liver. Hepatocytes extract bile acids very efficiently from sinusoidal blood and little escapes the healthy liver into the systemic circulation. Bile acids are then transported across the hepatocytes to be re-secreted into the canaliculi. The net effect of this enterohepatic recirculation is that each bile salt molecule is reused about 20 times, often two or three times during a single digestive phase.

### Q2.57
A 25-yo man has cholecystokinin deficiency as a component of an autoimmune polyglandular syndrome. Which of the following effects is likely to be seen in this patient as a result of _cholecystokinin deficiency_?

	A. Increased pancreatic enzyme secretion
	B. Enhanced gallbladder contraction
	C. Contraction of the Sphincter of Oddi
	D. Inhibition of gastric emptying
	E. Stimulation of small bowel motility

#### Answer: A. Increased pancreatic enzyme secretion - *FALSE* = C. Contraction of the Sphincter of Oddi - TRUE
- Cholecystokinin plays a key role in facilitating digestion within the small intestine. It is secreted from mucosal epithelial cells in the first segment of the small intestine (duodenum), and stimulates delivery into the small intestine of digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the gallbladder. It is a linear peptide that is synthesised as a pre-prohormone, and then proteolytically cleaved to generate a family of peptides with the same carboxy ends. 
- Partially digested fats and proteins in the lumen of the duodenum release cholecystokinin which:
	1. Stimulates secretion of pancreatic enzymes
	2. Stimulates gallbladder contraction
	3. Relaxes the sphincter of oddi
	4. Inhibits gastric emptying
	5. Stimulates small bowel motility	
	6. Enhances secretin stimulation of pancreatic bicarbonate secretion.

### Q2.58
A 55-yo man with gradual onset of weight loss, diarrhoea, stomatitis and a necrolytic migrating erythema develops diabetes mellitus. On investigation he is diagnosed as having a _tumour of the cells of the pancreas_. Which of the following physiological abnormalities is most likely to be present in this patient?

	A. Inhibition of gluconeogenesis
	B. Inhibition of lipolysis
	C. Inhibition of catecholamine secretion
	D. Activation of glycogenolysis
	E. Stimulation of gastric secreting activity

#### Answer: D. Activation of glycogenolysis - TRUE
- The clinical presentation is classic for a glucagonoma, which is a rare neuroendocrine tumour with almost exclusive pancreatic localisation. Malignant glucagonomas are islet cell pancreatic tumours that are discovered because of the glucagonoma syndrome or local mass effects, or incidentally. Glucagonomas originate from the 2 cells of the pancreas. This tumour is characterised by glucagon overproduction, diabetes mellitus, hypoaminoacidaemia, weight loss, normochromic and normocytic anaemia, and a necrolytic migrating erythema, which is the most characteristic clinical sign of this pathology. 
- Physiological glucagon activity includes:
	- Activation of gluconeogenesis
	- Stimulation of lipolysis
	- Stimulation of catecholamine secretion
	- Activation of glycogenolysis with contemporary glycolysis inhibition
	- Inhibition of the gastric secreting activity
	- Inhibition of the pancreatic secreting activity
	- Inhibition of the gastrointestinal motility
	- Stimulation of urinary excretion of water and phosphates as well as Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+
- When glucagon production is a result of a secreting tumour, it becomes independent and loses the feedback control mechanisms, and the subsequent increase of glucagon concentration in the blood causes the symptoms. Diabetes mellitus occurs in patients with a glucagonoma because of the lack of equilibrium between insulin production and glucagon production, which occurs when there are high serum levels of glucagon and normal levels of insulin or when insulin production is reduced and a normal glucagon level is present. However, glucagon may not induce hyperglycaemia directly unless metabolism of glucose by the liver is compromised directly.

### Q2.59
A 46-yo man with a _mechanical mitral valve_ and atrial fibrillation (AF) developed mesenteric ischaemia as a result of thromboembolism from the valve. Upon exploratory laparotomy the whole of the _jejunum was noticed to be gangrenous and resected_. Absorption of which of the following substances is likely to be affected in this patient?

	A. Vitamin B12 - F
	B. Water - F
	C. Electrolytes
	D. Bile salts - F
	E. Fat-soluble vitamins
	
#### Answer: E. Fat-soluble vitamins - TRUE
- Macronutrients and micronutrients are absorbed along the length of the small intestine. However, as the jejunum has taller villi, deeper crypts and greater enzyme activity compared with the ileum under normal conditions, about 90% of digestion and absorption of significant macronutrients and micronutrients are accomplished in the proximal 100–150cm of the jejunum. This includes absorption of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins B and C and folic acid, and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K.
- The ileum is the site for absorption of water and electrolytes. In addition, the terminal ileum is the site of absorption of bile salts and vitamin B12. Water is also absorbed from the colon. Colonic water absorption could be increased to as much as five times its normal capacity after small bowel resection.

### Q2.60
After a total hip replacement (THR) a 78-yo woman developed a pulmonary embolism (PE) that caused _obstruction of a branch of the pulmonary artery_. Which of the following is likely to increase in this patient?

	A. Ventilation/perfusion ratio
	B. Lung volume
	C. Arterial CO2
	D. Arterial O2
	E. Alveolar O2 saturation

#### Answer: A. Ventilation/perfusion ratio - TRUE
- The pathophysiological changes that follow pulmonary embolism (PE) involve derangements in pulmonary haemodynamics, gas exchange and mechanics. The change in cardiopulmonary function is proportional to the extent of obstruction, which varies with the size and number of emboli obstructing the pulmonary arteries, and to the patient’s pre-embolic cardiopulmonary status. The resulting physiological changes may include pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular failure and shock, dyspnoea with tachypnoea and hyperventilation, arterial hypoxaemia and pulmonary infarction. Tachypnoea, often with dyspnoea, almost always occurs after a PE. It appears to be a result of stimulation of juxtacapillary receptors in the alveolar capillary membrane by swelling of the alveolar interstitial space. This stimulation increases reflex vagal afferent activity, which stimulates medullary respiratory neurons. Consequent alveolar hyperventilation is manifested by a lowered Paco2. After occlusion of the pulmonary artery, areas of the lung are ventilated but not perfused, resulting in wasted ventilation with an increased ventilation/perfusion ratio – the physiological hallmark of PE – contributing further to the hyperventilatory state. Depletion of alveolar surfactant within hours of the embolic event results in diminished lung volume and compliance. Reduced lung volume secondary to atelectasis or infarction after PE may be manifest on the chest radiograph by diaphragmatic elevation. Diminished lung volume and possibly lowered airway Paco2 may induce bronchoconstriction, leading to expiratory wheezing. Arterial hypoxaemia typically occurs with diminished arterial O2 saturation (Sao2 from 94% to 85%), although the Sao2 may be normal. Hypoxaemia is caused by right-to-left shunting in areas of partial or complete atelectasis not affected by embolisation. A ventilation/perfusion imbalance probably also contributes to hypoxaemia. The mechanisms responsible for the ventilation/perfusion imbalance and atelectasis are not fully defined. In massive PE, severe hypoxaemia may result from right atrial hypertension that causes right-to-left shunting of blood through a patent foramen ovale. Low venous O2 tension may also contribute to development of arterial hypoxaemia.

### Q2.61
A woman pulled from a fire is _markedly hypoxic_. Respiration in this patient will be rapidly influenced by hypoxia through its _stimulatory effect_:

	A. Directly on the medullary respiratory neurons
	B. Directly on the pulmonary mechanoreceptors
	C. On the central chemoreceptors
	D. On the carotid and aortic chemoreceptors
	E. Directly on the Hb–O2 dissociation curve

#### Answer: D. On the carotid and aortic chemoreceptors - TRUE
- The carotid and aortic bodies are able to monitor the physically dissolved O2 and CO2 and the H+ concentration of arterial blood. These chemoreceptors are stimulated by a decline in the PO2, especially when it falls below 8kPa (60mmHg). They are also stimulated by an increase in the arterial blood H+ concentration (decreased pH) or an increase in physically dissolved CO2 (or PCO2). Although it is not clear precisely how increases in H+ or CO2 or decreases in the PO2 stimulate the chemoreceptors, the peripheral chemoreceptors are the only sensors capable of detecting a fall in the PO2. Thus, the peripheral chemoreceptors account for increases in ventilation resulting from hypoxia. However, these chemoreceptors detect only levels of physically dissolved O2 and not the O2 that is chemically attached to haemoglobin. In contrast to the peripheral receptors, the central chemoreceptors are not sensitive to changes in the PO2 of cerebral blood or CSF.

### Q2.62
A 66-yo man who is a chronic smoker is admitted for elective repair of a right-sided indirect inguinal hernia. His clinical examination and chest radiological findings are consistent with _chronic obstructive airway disease_. He is sent for _pulmonary function tests_ (PFTs). 

Which of the following abnormalities is most likely to be present in this patients?

	A. Increased FEV1/FVC (forced expiratory volume in 1s/forced vital capacity) - F
	B. Decreased total lung capacity (TLC) - F
	C. Increased residual volume (RV)
	D. Decreased functional residual capacity (FRC) - F
	E. Increased carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) - F
	
#### Answer: C. Increased residual volume (RV) - TRUE
- The best diagnostic test for evaluating patients with suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is lung function measured with spirometry. Key spirometric measures may be obtained with a portable office spirometer and should include forced vital capacity (FVC) and the normal forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (FEV1). The ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) normally exceeds 0.75. Patients with COPD typically present with obstructive airflow. A FEV1/FVC ratio <70% in a patient with a postbronchodilator FEV1 <80% of the predicted value is diagnostic for COPD. Severity is further stratified based on symptoms and FEV1 values. A patient with severe disease has a FEV1 <50% of the predicted value; values below 30% of the predicted value represent very severe disease. Beyond office spirometry, complete pulmonary function testing may show increased total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV). A substantial loss of lung surface area available for effective oxygen exchange causes diminished carbon monoxide diffusion in the lung (DLCO) in patients with emphysema. This finding may help distinguish COPD from asthma, because patients with asthma typically have normal DLCO values.

### Q2.63
A patient with _deteriorating renal function_ is to undergo estimation of his glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Which of the following substances will be the best choice for the estimation of GFR in this patient?

	A. Urea
	B. Inulin
	C. PAH
	D. Creatinine
	E. 51Cr-labelled EDTA
	
#### Answer: D. Creatinine - *FALSE* = B. Inulin - TRUE
- The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is generally considered the best measure of renal function despite the fact that the kidney performs an array of duties, including salt and water balance, erythropoiesis, bone metabolism, electrolyte homeostasis and blood pressure control. GFR is traditionally measured as the renal clearance of a particular substance from plasma and is expressed as the volume of plasma that can be completely cleared of that substance in a unit of time. The ideal marker for GFR determinations would appear endogenously in the plasma at a constant rate, be freely filtered at the glomerulus, be neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the renal tubule and undergo no extrarenal elimination. 
- GFR is calculated as follows:
	- Ux = concentration of x in a timed urine collection (mg/ml)
	- V = volume of urine per unit time (ml/min)
	- Px = concentration of x in plasma (mg/ml)
	- UxV = rate of urinary excretion of x = excreted load (mg/min)
	- Cx = UxV/Px = the (plasma) clearance of x (ml/min)
 
- Cx is the volume of plasma containing x that would have to be completely cleared of x per unit time to supply an amount of x for urinary excretion at the measured rate. Clearance does not necessarily mean that an actual volume of plasma is, in fact, completely cleared of x. Rather, it refers to a ‘virtual volume’ of plasma that would provide the measured amount of x.
- A substance that is freely filtered and undergoes neither reabsorption nor secretion will have a clearance equal to the GFR. The clearance of inulin, a carbohydrate polymer of fructose, measured during a constant infusion, is the standard for measurement of GFR. A clearance greater than that of inulin indicates that a substance also undergoes tubular secretion; a clearance less than that of inulin implies tubular reabsorption.
- Rewriting the clearance equation for x:inulin, we have:
	- Cinulin:Uinulin × V/Pinulin
 
- As a result of the difficulty in performing inulin clearance, the clearance of endogenous creatinine is used for clinical purposes as an estimate of the GFR. Its plasma concentration remains stable during a 24-hour period and its rate of excretion does not vary with urine flow. Thus, creatinine clearance (Ccr) can be calculated during a 24-hour collection of urine, with a plasma sample obtained at any time during the collection period. In a normal man, filtered creatinine does not undergo tubular reabsorption; some tubular secretion does occur. At the plasma creatinine concentration that prevails at a normal GFR, the ration Ccr/Cinulin is close to 1, implying negligible secretion. At progressively lower GFRs, however, tubular secretion plays an increasingly important part in creatinine excretion. At GFRs <30ml/ min, Ccr may overestimate Cinulin by 50–80%.
- Blood urea is generally recognised to be a poor measure of renal function, in that it possesses few of the attributes of an ideal marker of GFR. It is produced at variable rates, is affected by a number of disease states (congestive heart failure, malnutrition, hyperalimentation) and undergoes renal tubular reabsorption. PAH is used for estimation of the renal plasma flow rate. 51Cr-labelled EDTA, has been used as a reliable measure of glomerular filtration but is costly, involves special specimen handling and requires radiation exposure.

### Q2.64
A 76-yo woman undergoes sigmoid colectomy for _ruptured diverticulum_. Her baseline BP is 140/80 mmHg. She requires multiple boluses of phenylephrine in the operating room to support her BP. On return to ICU, the patient is mechanically ventilated and her BP is 90/50 mmHg. Her urinary output is 15mL in the first hour. Which of the following is the best strategy to _improve her urine output_?

	A. Start infusion of an inotrope
	B. Give intravenous corticosteroids
	C. Insert a Swan–Ganz catheter
	D. Use a stroke volume monitor
	E. Fluid challenge followed by vasopressor

#### Answer: E. Fluid challenge followed by vasopressor - TRUE
- Oliguria is hypotension or hypovolaemia until otherwise proved. This patient is likely to be hypovolaemic as well as vasoplegic secondary to fluid loss in the abdomen and release of inflammatory mediators (particularly inducible nitric oxide synthase) as a result of faecal soiling. The best strategy will be to give her a fluid challenge with 200–250ml of colloid solution followed by infusion of noradrenaline, which is a vasopressor. Unless the low urinary output is the result of poor cardiac performance, there is little to be learned by insertion of a Swan–Ganz catheter. If there is concern that this patient had a history of coronary arterial disease, and may have had a perioperative myocardial event, a stroke volume monitor may be useful. Inotrope may be indicated if the patient has poor ventricular function. Corticosteroids have no role in this clinical scenario.

### Q2.65
A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension (usual BP 150/90) and intermittent atrial fibrillation is admitted to the Emergency Department with a 6-hour history of a _painful white leg_. A large embolus is located in his left internal iliac artery, with distal ischaemia. He is brought to the operating room for embolectomy– revascularisation. Just before induction his BP is 200/100mmHg, which is treated with a labetalol infusion. Once circulation to the affected limb is re-established successfully, the BP falls to 160/90mmHg and the labetalol infusion is stopped. The patient is otherwise stable and is returned to the ICU postoperatively. Preoperatively his creatinine was 1.1mg/dl; 6 h postoperatively it was 1.8mg/dl. His urine was noticed to be tea coloured. The next morning the patient becomes anuric with a creatinine of 2.5mg/dl. His potassium is 6.8mmol/L and phosphate 1.9mmol/L. There is no evidence of postrenal obstruction. He is started on continuous haemofiltration. Which of the following is the _most likely cause for this patient’s acute renal failure_?

	A. Systemic hypertension
	B. Labetalol infusion
	C. Rhabdomyolyis
	D. Hyperkalaemia
	E. Atrial fibrillation

#### Answer: C. Rhabdomyolyis - TRUE
- The diagnosis is acute rhabdomyolysis after reperfusion. The ischaemia–reperfusion injury causes swelling and destruction of muscle cells, leading to the release of cellular contents into the circulation. The mechanism of injury appears to be calcium influx, free radical generation, disruption of the microcirculation, and release of cytotoxic materials and proteases into the local environment. The result is acidosis, hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia and a massive increase in circulating myoglobin levels. Usually myoglobin is reabsorbed by the proximal tubule and metabolised, releasing free iron that is soaked up by glutathione, but in rhabdomyolysis this mechanism is overwhelmed. Free iron generates free radicals, which are nephrotoxic. In addition, in the presence of acidic urine, myoglobin binds with a renal excretory protein (Tamm–Horsfall) to form casts that obstruct the tubules and cause acute tubular necrosis. The diagnosis can be made by measuring serum creatine kinase levels and checking urinary myoglobin (the urine is usually tea coloured).

### Q2.66 - LEARN
A 26-yo man falls from a ladder and sustains injury to the back of his neck. Computed tomography (CT) reveals a bony fragment that penetrated the _lateral portion of the dorsal columns_. Which of the following functions is most likely to affected by this lesion?

	A. Vibratory sensations from the ipsilateral arm
	B. Fine motor control of the ipsilateral fingers
	C. Motor control of the contralateral foot
	D. Sweating of the ipsilateral face
	E. Proprioception from the ipsilateral leg
	
#### Answer: C. Motor control of the contralateral foot - *FALSE* = A. Vibratory sensations from the ipsilateral arm - TRUE
- At this level, the lateral portion of the dorsal columns (dorsal funiculus) is composed of the fasciculus cuneatus. Axons carrying tactile, proprioceptive and vibratory information from the ipsilateral arm enter the spinal cord via the dorsal root, ascend the cord in the fasciculus cuneatus and synapse in the nucleus cuneatus of the caudal medulla. Secondary neurons from this nucleus give rise to internal arcuate fibres, which decussate and ascend to the thalamus (ventral posterolateral nucleus or VPl) as the medial lemniscus. Tertiary neurons from the VPl project to the ipsilateral somatosensory cortex. Therefore, damage to the fasciculus cuneatus would result in a deficit in tactile, proprioceptive and vibratory sensations in the ipsilateral arm, because the fibres that carry this information do not cross until they reach the medulla.
- Fine motor control of the fingers is principally carried by the ipsilateral corticospinal tract in the lateral funiculus of the cord. Motor control of the contralateral foot is carried by the ipsilateral corticospinal tract in the lateral funiculus of the cord. Hemianhidrosis (lack of sweating) of the face could be produced by interruption of sympathetic innervation to the face. The hypothalamospinal tract projects from the hypothalamus to the intermediolateral cell column at levels T1–2. It descends the cord in the lateral funiculus. Interruption of this tract results in Horner’s syndrome (miosis, ptosis, hemianhidrosis). Proprioception from the ipsilateral leg is carried by fasciculus gracilis in the medial part of the dorsal columns.

### Q2.67
A 55-yr old man is admitted to an ICU with _acute respiratory distress syndrome_ (ARDS). Which of the following variables is most likely to be _lower than normal_ in this patient?

	A. Oncotic pressure of alveolar fluid
	B. Work of breathing
	C. Lung compliance
	D. Alveolar–arterial pressure difference
	E. Surface tension of alveolar fluid
	
#### Answer: E. Surface tension of alveolar fluid - *FALSE* = C. Lung compliance - TRUE
- The development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) starts with damage to the alveolar epithelium and vascular endothelium, resulting in increased permeability to plasma and inflammatory cells into the interstitium and alveolar space and in lung oedema. Damage to the surfactant-producing type II cells and the presence of protein-rich fluid in the alveolar space disrupt the production and function of pulmonary surfactant, leading to microatelectasis and impaired gas exchange. The pathophysiological consequences of lung oedema in ARDS include a decrease in lung volumes, compliance and large intrapulmonary shunts (blood perfusing unventilated segments of the lung). A fall in the RV is uniformly present and contributes to ventilation/perfusion inequality. It has been hypothesised that a defective surfactant may be partially responsible for the small lung volumes and that it may worsen oedema accumulation in ARDS (as increases in alveolar surface tension have been shown to increase lung water content by lowering interstitial hydrostatic pressure and increasing interstitital oncotic pressure. The decrease in lung compliance is secondary to the increased lung recoil pressure of the oedematous lung, which clinically increases the work of breathing and leads to respiratory muscle fatigue.

### Q2.68
A 43-yo man has a parathyroid adenoma producing elevated levels of parathyroid hormone. Which of the following statements about _parathyroid hormone_ (PTH) is true?

	A. Increased ionised calcium levels are essential for its release
	B. It causes increased deposition of calcium in bones - F
	C. It stimulates production of the active form of vitamin D in the small intestine
	D. It stimulates loss of phosphate ions in the urine
	E. It stimulates excretion of calcium in the urine
	
#### Answer: C. It stimulates production of the active form of vitamin D in the small intestine - *FALSE* = D. It stimulates loss of phosphate ions in the urine - TRUE
- Parathyroid hormone is the most important endocrine regulator of calcium and phosphorus concentration in extracellular fluid. This hormone is secreted from cells of the parathyroid glands and finds its major target cells in bone and the kidneys. It stimulates osteoclasts to resorb bone mineral, liberating calcium into the blood. It facilitates calcium absorption from the small intestine indirectly by stimulating production of the active form of vitamin D in the kidney. Vitamin D induces synthesis of a calcium-binding protein in intestinal epithelial cells, which facilitates efficient absorption of calcium into the blood. In addition to stimulating fluxes of calcium into the blood from bone and the intestine, parathyroid hormone puts a brake on excretion of calcium in the urine, thus conserving calcium in the blood. This effect is mediated by stimulating tubular reabsorption of calcium. Another effect of parathyroid hormone on the kidney is to stimulate loss of phosphate ions in the urine. Parathyroid hormone is released in response to low extracellular concentrations of free calcium. Changes in blood phosphate concentration can be associated with changes in parathyroid hormone secretion, but this appears to be an indirect effect and phosphate itself is not a significant regulator of this hormone. When calcium concentrations fall below the normal range, there is a steep increase in secretion of parathyroid hormone. Low levels of the hormone are secreted even when blood calcium levels are high.

### Q2.69
Hypoxia generally causes vasodilatation in arterial beds. In which organ does _hypoxia cause vasoconstriction of arterial beds_?

	A. Skeletal muscle
	B. Heart
	C. Kidney
	D. Gut
	E. Lungs
	
#### Answer: E. Lungs - TRUE
- Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is a local response to hypoxia, resulting primarily from constriction of small muscular pulmonary arteries in response to reduced alveolar oxygen tension. This unique response of pulmonary arterioles results in a local adjustment of perfusion to ventilation. This means that, if a bronchiole is obstructed, the lack of oxygen causes contraction of the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle in the corresponding area, shunting blood away from the hypoxic region to better-ventilated regions. Skeletal muscle, heart, kidney and gut arteries all dilate under hypoxic conditions, resulting in increased blood flow to these organs.

### Q2.70
Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a naturally occurring thrombolytic substance. The thrombolytic mechanism of action of tPA involves:

	A. Proteolytic breakdown of fibrin
	B. Direct conversion of plasminogen to plasmin
	C. Depletion of α2-antiplasmin
	D. Proteolytic activation of fibrinogen
	E. Formation of an active complex with plasminogen

#### Answer: D. Proteolytic activation of fibrinogen - *FALSE* = B. Direct conversion of plasminogen to plasmin - TRUE
- Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) directly catalyses the proteolytic conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Alteplase (tPA, Activase) was the first recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator and is identical to native tissue plasminogen activator. In vivo, tissue-type plasminogen activator is synthesised and made available by cells of the vascular endothelium. It is the physiological thrombolytic agent responsible for most of the body’s natural efforts to prevent excessive thrombus propagation. Alteplase is the fibrinolytic agent most familiar to the Emergency Department and is the lytic agent most often used for the treatment of coronary artery thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and acute stroke. In theory, alteplase should be effective only at the surface of fibrin clot. In practice, however, a systemic lytic state is seen, with moderate amounts of circulating fibrin degradation products and a substantial systemic bleeding risk. The agent may be readministered as necessary, because it is not antigenic and almost never associated with any allergic manifestations.

### Q2.71
The _liver function tests_ of a patient show hyPERbilirubinaemia. The bilirubin is predominantly conjugated. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be associated with an _increase in conjugated bilirubin_?

	A. Physiological jaundice of the newborn
	B. Haemolysis caused by rhesus incompatibility
	C. Acute haemolytic crisis in sickle cell disease
	D. Obstructive jaundice resulting from carcinoma of the head of the pancreas
	E. Gilbert’s syndrome
	
#### Answer: D. Obstructive jaundice resulting from carcinoma of the head of the pancreas - TRUE
- Bilirubin is a tetrapyrrole created by the normal breakdown of haem. Most bilirubin is produced during the breakdown of haemoglobin and other haemoproteins. Accumulation of bilirubin or its conjugates in body tissues produces jaundice, which is characterised by high plasma bilirubin levels and deposition of yellow bilirubin pigments in the skin, sclerae, mucous membranes and other less visible tissues. As bilirubin is highly insoluble in water, it must be converted into a soluble conjugate before elimination from the body. In the liver, uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronyl transferase converts bilirubin to a mixture of monoglucuronides and diglucuronides, referred to as conjugated (direct) bilirubin, which is then secreted into the bile by an ATP-dependent transporter. This process is highly efficient under normal conditions, so plasma unconjugated bilirubin concentrations remain low. Normal serum values of total bilirubin are typically 0.2–1mg/dl (3.4–17.1mmol/L), of which no more than 0.2mg/dl (3.4mmol/L) directly reacts. Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia results from reduced secretion of conjugated bilirubin into the bile, as occurs in patients with hepatitis, or from impaired flow of bile into the intestine, as occurs in patients with biliary obstruction caused by tumours in the head of the pancreas. Bile formation is very sensitive to a variety of hepatic insults, including high levels of inflammatory cytokines as may occur in patients with septic shock. Diseases that increase the rate of bilirubin formation, such as haemolysis, or diseases that reduce the rate of bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert’s syndrome, produce unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.


### Q2.72
A 22-yo man with aortic stenosis caused by a congenital bicuspid valve is to undergo aortic valve replacement. On pre-operative assessment the oxygen consumption in this patient is 300 mL/min, arterial O2 content 20mL/100mL blood, pulmonary arterial content 15mL/100mL blood and his HR 100 beats/min. What is the _cardiac stroke volume_ in this patient?

	A.   1 mL
	B.  10 mL
	C.  60 mL
	D. 100 mL
	E. 200 mL
	
#### Answer: C.  60 mL (*Guess*) - TRUE
- CO = SV x HR 
- 5 mL/100mL consumed, 300/5 = 60

- Stroke volume is calculated by using the following formula:
	- Cardiac output (CO) = Stroke volume (SV) × Heart rate (HR)
- Cardiac output is calculated by using the following formula based on Fick’s principle:
	- VO2 = Q (Cao2 – Cvo2) where 
 		- VO2 is oxygen consumption
 		- Q-cardiac output
 		- Cao2 = arterial oxygen content 
 		- Cvo2 = mixed venous oxygen content
- Substituting the values in this formula we get:
	- 300ml/min = Q × [(20 – 15)ml]/100ml
	- Q = [(300 × 100)/5]ml/min
	- Q = 6000ml/min
- Next, stroke volume (SV) is calculated as follows:
	- 6000ml/min = SV × 100 beats/min
	- SV = [6000/100]ml/min
	- SV = 60ml/min

### Q2.73
A patient with a ruptured spleen and fractured pelvis as a result of a RTA arrives in the ED in a state of shock. Which of the following organs with the _largest specific blood flow per gram of tissue_ under resting conditions is most vulnerable in this patient?

	A. Kidney
	B. Heart
	C. Brain
	D. Skin
	E. Skeletal muscle
	
#### Answer: A. Kidney - TRUE
- Under normal resting conditions, about 5% of the cardiac output goes to the heart, 15% to the brain, 20% to the skin and skeletal muscles, 30% to the gastrointestinal tract and 20% to the kidneys. However, when normalised by weight, the kidneys receive the largest specific blood flow (400ml/min per 100g) at rest and are particularly at risk during haemorrhagic shock. The brain also receives a relatively high specific blood flow (50ml/min per 100g) as does the heart (60ml/min per 100g). Blood flow through the skin varies between 1 and 100ml/min per 100g and serves temperature regulation. Skeletal muscle under resting conditions has low specific blood flow ranging between 1 and 2ml/min per 100g which may increase up to 20-fold during heavy exercise.

### Q2.74
A 13-yo boy is Dx with a growth hormone (GH)-secreting tumour of the anterior pituitary gland. Which of the following _metabolic effects resulting from increased GH secretion_ is most likely to be enhanced in this patient?

	A. Decreased amino acid uptake
	B. Enhanced oxidation of proteins
	C. Enhanced triglyceride synthesis
	D. Decreased fat oxidation in adipocytes
	E. Enhanced glucose synthesis in the liver
 
#### Answer: B. Enhanced oxidation of proteins - *FALSE* = E. Enhanced glucose synthesis in the liver - TRUE
- Growth hormone (GH), also known as somatotrophin, is a protein hormone of about 190 amino acids that is synthesised and secreted by cells called somatotrophs in the anterior pituitary. It is a major participant in control of several complex physiological processes, including growth and metabolism. GH is also of considerable interest as a drug used in both humans and animals. It has important effects on protein, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. In general, GH stimulates protein anabolism in many tissues. This effect reflects increased amino acid uptake, increased protein synthesis and decreased oxidation of proteins. GH enhances the utilisation of fat by stimulating triglyceride breakdown and oxidation in adipocytes. It is one of a battery of hormones that serves to maintain blood glucose within a normal range. GH is often said to have anti-insulin activity, because it suppresses the abilities of insulin to stimulate uptake of glucose in peripheral tissues and enhances glucose synthesis in the liver.

### Q2.75
A steel furnace worker is admitted to ED with _severe acute dehydration_. This patient is most likely to have:

	A. High renal water excretion
	B. Low permeability of collecting duct tubular cells for water
	C. Low plasma ADH levels - F
	D. Decreased baroreceptor firing rate - F
	E. Decreased plasma osmolality - F
	
#### Answer: A. High renal water excretion - *FALSE* = D. Decreased baroreceptor firing rate - TRUE
- Dehydration describes a state of negative fluid balance that may be caused by decreased intake, increased output (renal, gastrointestinal or insensible losses) or fluid shift (ascites, effusions and capillary leak states such as burns and sepsis). The decrease in total body water causes reductions in both the intracellular and extracellular fluid volumes. Clinical manifestations of dehydration are most closely related to intravascular volume depletion. As dehydration progresses, hypovolaemic shock ultimately ensues, resulting in end-organ failure and death. In acute dehydration, plasma osmolality is increased as more water than salt is lost. The decrease in total body water and plasma volume leads to an inhibition of the baroreceptors and a lower firing rate. The increase in plasma osmolality leads to increased ADH secretion and high plasma ADH levels, which increases the water permeability of collecting duct cells. This leads to more absorption of water by the kidneys and low renal water excretion.

### Q2.76
Omeprazole is an acid-activated prodrug that binds covalently to the proton pump located at the apical membrane of the gastric parietal cells, resulting in its irreversible inactivation. Which of the following is the _site of action of omeprazole_?

	A. Active H+ and Cl– co-transport
	B. H+/K+ ATPase
	C. Cl–/HCO3– exchange
	D. Passive diffusion of H+
	E. Na+/K+ pump
	
#### Answer: B. H+/K+ ATPase - TRUE
- The key player in acid secretion is a H+/K+ ATPase or ‘proton pump’ located in the canalicular membrane. This ATPase is magnesium dependent and not inhibited by ouabain. Parietal cells secrete an essentially isotonic solution of pure hydrochloric acid (HCl) containing 150mmol/L Cl– and 150mmol/L H+ (pH <1). Intracellular H+ of parietal cells is 10–4 mol/L (pH = 7.0) and active transport is necessary to transport H+ against this gradient. This is achieved by H+/K+ ATPase in the apical membrane, which exchanges H+ for K+.

### Q2.77
When a patient has a lower than normal haemoglobin, it is important to determine whether RBCs are of normal size and whether they have a normal concentration of Hb. These measurements, known as erythrocyte or RBC indices, provide important information above various types of anaemia. Which of the following is correct?

	A. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) = Haematocrit × Total RBC count - F
	B. MCV = Hb × Total RBC count - F
	C. Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) = Haemoglobin × [Total RBC count/100]
	D. MCH concentration (MCHC) = [Haemoglobin/Haematocrit] × 100
	E. MCHC = Haemoglobin/Total RBC count
	
#### Answer: E. MCHC = Haemoglobin/Total RBC count - *FALSE* = D. MCH concentration (MCHC) = [Haemoglobin/Haematocrit] × 100 - TRUE
- The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) measures the mean or average size of individual RBCs. To obtain the MCV, the haematocrit is divided by the total RBC count. The MCV is an indicator of the size of the RBCs. If the MCV is low, the cells are microcytic or smaller than normal. Microcytic red blood cells are seen in iron deficiency anaemia, lead poisoning and the genetic diseases thalassaemia major and minor. If the MCV is high, the cells are macrocytic, or larger than normal. Macrocytic RBCs are associated with pernicious anaemia and folic acid deficiencies. If the MCV is within the normal range, the cells are referred to as normocytic. A patient who has anaemia from an acute haemorrhage would have a normocytic anaemia.
Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) measures the amount, or the mass, of haemoglobin present in one RBC. The weight of haemoglobin in an average cell is obtained by dividing the haemoglobin by the total RBC count. The result is reported as picograms.
MCH concentration (MCHC) measures the proportion of each cell taken up by haemoglobin. The results are reported in percentages, reflecting the proportion of haemoglobin in the RBCs. The haemoglobin is divided by the haematocrit and multiplied by 100 to obtain the MCHC.
The MCH and MCHC are used to assess whether RBCs are normochromic, hypochromic or hyperchromic. An MCHC <32% indicates that the RBCs are deficient in haemoglobin concentration. This situation is most often seen with iron deficiency anaemia.
Normal values for erythrocyte indices are:
•    MCV:
•    men: 80–98 fl (femtolitres)
•    women: 96–108 fl
•    MCH: 17–31 pg
•    MCHC: 32–36%.
 
Anaemias can be classified using erythrocyte indices in the following way:
•    MCV, MCH and MCHC normal – normocytic/ normochromic anaemia – most often caused by acute blood loss.
•    Decreased MCV, MCH and MCHC – microcytic/ hypochromic anaemia – most often caused by iron deficiency.
•    Increased MCV, variable MCH and MCHC – macrocytic anaemia – most often caused by vitamin B12 deficiency (caused by pernicious anaemia) and folic acid deficiency.

### Q2.78
A 22-year-old woman with paroxysmal hypertension, tachycardia, diaphoresis, tachypnoea, flushing, cold and clammy skin, severe headache, angina and palpitation is diagnosed with a _phaeochromocytoma_. The urine levels of which of the following substances will be high in this patient?

	A. Dehydroepiandrosterone
	B. Pregnanetriol
	C. Cortisol
	D. Homovanillic acid
	E. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid
	
#### Answer: A. Dehydroepiandrosterone - *FALSE* = D. Homovanillic acid - TRUE
- Phaeochromocytoma is a tumour that arises in the adrenal medulla and secretes catecholamines. The principal urinary metabolic products of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) are the metanephrines, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA). Normal individuals excrete only very small amounts of these substances in the urine. Normal values for 24 h are as follows: free adrenaline and noradrenaline <100µg (<582nmol), total metanephrine <1.3mg (<7.1µmol), VMA <10mg (<50µmol) and HVA <15mg (<82.4µmol). In phaeochromocytoma and neuroblastoma, urinary excretion of adrenaline, noradrenaline and their metabolic products increases intermittently. However, excretion of these compounds may also be elevated in coma, dehydration or extreme stress states, in patients being treated with rauwolfia alkaloids, methyldopa or catecholamines, or after ingestion of foods containing large quantities of vanilla, especially if renal insufficiency is present. All of these compounds may be measured in the same urine specimen.
- Urinary dehydroepiandrosterone and pregnanetriol excretion is often increased in congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Free urinary cortisol levels are elevated in Cushing’s syndrome. Increased urinary excretion of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is seen in functioning carcinoids.

### Q2.79 - LEARN
Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) is a group of genetically distinct familial diseases involving adenomatous hyperplasia and malignant tumour formation in several endocrine glands. Which of the following statements about MEN is true?

	A. MEN 1 is characterised by tumours of the parathyroid gland, pancreatic islet cells and pituitary gland
	B. MEN 1 is characterised by medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, phaeochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism
	C. MEN 2A is characterised by multiple mucosal neuroma, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and phaeochromocytoma, often associated with a marfanoid habitus
	D. MEN 2A is characterised by tumours of pancreatic islet cells and panhypopituitarism
	E. MEN 2B is characterised by tumours of the parathyroid glands, pancreatic islet cells and pituitary gland - F
	
#### Answer: A. MEN 1 is characterised by tumours of the parathyroid gland, pancreatic islet cells and pituitary gland - TRUE
- MEN 1 is characterised by tumours of the parathyroid gland, pancreatic islet cells and pituitary gland. The gene causing MEN 1 has recently been identified on chromosome 11 and appears to function as a tumour-suppressor gene. The clinical features of the MEN 1 syndrome depend on the pattern of tumour involvement in the individual patient. Hyperparathyroidism is present in at least 90% of affected patients. Asymptomatic hypercalcaemia is the most common manifestation; about 25% of patients have evidence of nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. In contrast to sporadic cases of hyperparathyroidism, diffuse hyperplasia or multiple adenomas are found more frequently than solitary adenomas.
MEN 2A is characterised by medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, phaeochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism. The clinical features of MEN 2A depend on the type of tumour present. Almost all patients with the MEN 2A syndrome have medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Phaeochromocytoma occurs in about 50% of patients within MEN 2A. Hyperparathyroidism is less common than medullary carcinoma of the thyroid or phaeochromocytoma. About 25% of affected patients within MEN 2A have clinical evidence of hyperparathyroidism (which may be long standing), with hypercalcaemia, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis or renal failure.
The distinctive feature of MEN 2B syndrome is the presence of mucosal neuromas in most, if not all, affected patients. The neuromas appear as small glistening bumps about the lips, tongue and buccal mucosa. The eyelids, conjunctivae and corneas are also commonly involved. Thickened eyelids and diffusely hypertrophied lips are characteristic. Gastrointestinal abnormalities related to altered motility (constipation, diarrhoea and, occasionally, megacolon) are common and thought to result from diffuse intestinal ganglioneuromatosis. About half the reported cases show the complete syndrome with mucosal neuromas, phaeochromocytomas and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Less than 10% have neuromas and phaeochromocytomas alone, whereas the remainder have neuromas and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid without phaeochromocytoma.
Recent genetic studies have mapped the genetic defects in MEN 2A, MEN 2B, familial medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and Hirschsprung’s disease to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 10 and have identified mutations in a specific receptor tyrosine kinase gene, ret, suggesting that this dominant oncogene is responsible for the abnormalities associated with these conditions.

### Q2.80
Calcium is required for the proper functioning of numerous intracellular and extracellular processes, including muscle contraction, nerve conduction, hormone release and blood coagulation. 

Which of the following conditions is associated with hyPOcalcaemia?

	A. Vitamin D excess - F
	B. Magnesium depletion
	C. Sarcoidosis
	D. Immobilisation
	E. Milk-alkali syndrome - F

#### Answer: D. Immobilisation - *FALSE* = B. Magnesium depletion - TRUE
- Hypocalcaemia is defined as a decrease in total plasma calcium concentration <8.8mg/dl (2.2mmol/L) in the presence of a normal plasma protein concentration
- HyPOcalcaemia has a number of causes. These include:
	- HyPOparathyroidism
	- Vitamin D deficiency
	- Renal tubular disease
	- Renal failure
	- **Magnesium depletion**
	- Acute pancreatitis
	- HyPOproteinaemia
	- Enhanced bone formation with inadequate Ca2+ intake
	- Septic shock
	- HyPERphosphataemia
 
- Drugs associated with hypocalcaemia include those generally used to treat hypercalcaemia: anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital) and rifampin, which alter vitamin D metabolism; transfusion with blood products treated with citrate as well as radiocontrast agents containing the divalent ion-chelating agent EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetate).
- Magnesium depletion occurring with intestinal malabsorption or dietary deficiency can cause hypocalcaemia. Relative parathyroid hormone (PTH) deficiency and end-organ resistance to its action occur with magnesium depletion, resulting in plasma concentrations of <0.5mmol/L; repletion of magnesium improves PTH levels and renal Ca2+ conservation.
- Sarcoidosis, vitamin D excess, immobilisation and milk-alkali excess are associated with hyPERcalcaemia

### Q2.81
Magnesium is the 4th most plentiful cation in the body. Which of the following statement about _magnesium metabolism_ is true?

	A. 70kg adult has roughly 200 mmol magnesium - F
	B. The extracellular fluid contains about 50% total body magnesium - F
	C. Normal plasma magnesium concentration ranges from 0.70 to 1.05 mmol/L (1.4 to 2.1 mEq/L)
	D. About 10% of plasma magnesium is ultrafiltered by the kidneys - F
	E. Magnesium is the key electrolyte for generation of a smooth muscle action potential - F
	
#### Answer: C. Normal plasma magnesium concentration ranges from 0.70 to 1.05 mmol/L (1.4 to 2.1 mEq/L) - TRUE
- Magnesium (Mg2+) is the fourth most plentiful cation in the body. A 70kg adult has roughly 1000mmol Mg2+. About 50% is sequestered in bone and not readily exchangeable with other compartments. The extracellular fluid (ECF) contains only about 1% of total body Mg2+. The remainder resides in the intracellular compartment. Normal plasma Mg2+ concentration ranges from 0.70 to 1.05mmol/L. The maintenance of plasma Mg2+ concentration is largely a function of dietary intake and extremely effective renal and intestinal conservation. Within 7 days of initiation of a Mg2+-deficient diet, renal and faecal Mg2+ excretion each fall to about 0.5mmol/24 h. About 70% of plasma Mg2+ is ultrafiltered by the kidney; the remainder is bound to protein. As with Ca2+, protein binding of Mg2+ is pH dependent. Plasma Mg2+ concentration and either total body Mg2+ or intracellular Mg2+ content are not closely related. However, severe plasma hypomagnesaemia may reflect diminished body stores of Mg2+. A wide variety of enzymes are Mg2+ activated or dependent. Mg2+ is required by all enzymatic processes involving ATP and is also required by many of the enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism. Mg2+ is required for thiamine pyrophosphate cofactor activity and appears to stabilise the structure of macromolecules such as DNA and RNA. Mg2+ is also related to calcium and potassium metabolism in an intimate but poorly understood way.

### Q2.82
The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is a subdivision of the autonomic nervous system (ANS, and it operates in tandem with the other subdivision, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Which of the following is an effect of stimulation of the PNS?

	A. Dilatation of the pupils
	B. Decreased secretion of the lacrimal glands
	C. Bronchodilatation
	D. Bradycardia - F
	E. Ejaculation
	
#### Answer: A. Dilatation of the pupils - *FALSE* = D. Bradycardia - TRUE
- The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is one of two divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Sometimes called the ‘rest and digest’ system, the parasympathetic system conserves energy because it slows the heart rate, increases intestinal and gland activity, and relaxes sphincter muscles in the gastrointestinal tract. Although an oversimplification, it is said that the PNS acts in a reciprocal manner to the effects of the sympathetic nervous system; in fact, in some tissues innervated by both systems, the effects are synergistic.
- The PNS uses only acetylcholine (ACh) as its neurotransmitter. The ACh acts on two types of receptors: the muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Most transmissions occur in two stages: when stimulated, the preganglionic nerve releases ACh at the ganglion, which acts on nicotinic receptors of the postganglionic nerve. The postganglionic nerve then releases ACh to stimulate the muscarinic receptors of the target organ.
- Effects of parasympathetic stimulation:
	- Pupil: constriction (greater depth of focal field)
	- Ciliary muscle: constriction (near focus)
	- Lacrimal gland: secretion increased
	- Submandibular gland: secretion released and increased
	- Parotid gland: secretion increased
	- Heart: decreased pulse rate and myocardial responsiveness
	- Lung: constriction of air passages
	- Gut: increased peristaltic and segmentation motility
	- Liver: reduced blood glucose generation (from glycogen breakdown)
	- Pancreas: insulin release
	- Kidney: no innervation
	- Urinary bladder: relaxation of sphincter and contraction of bladder wall musculature
	- Penis: erection plus sensory facilitation (**Penis = PNS**)
	- Arterioles in general: no innervation
	- Arterioles in voluntary muscular system: no innervation
	- Piloerector muscles (raise hair or goosebumps): no innervation
	- Sweat glands: no innervation.


### Q2.83
After _cardiac survey_ a patient has a _very fast heart rate_ (HR). The ECG of this patient will show:

	A. A wider QRS complex
	B. A prolonged P–R interval - F
	C. A smaller QRS complex - F
	D. A longer ST segment - F
	E. A shortened Q–T interval - F

#### Answer: A. A wider QRS complex - *FALSE* = E. A shortened Q–T interval - TRUE
- An increased heart rate is associated with a shortened Q–T interval. The Q–T interval begins at the onset of the QRS complex and the end of the T wave. It represents the time between the start of ventricular depolarisation and the end of ventricular repolarisation. It is useful as a measure of the duration of repolarisation. The Q–T interval will vary depending-on the heart rate, age and gender. It increases with bradycardia and decreases with tachycardia. Men have shorter Q–T intervals (0.39 s) than women (0.41 s). The Q–T interval is influenced by electrolyte balance, drugs and ischaemia.

### Q2.84
Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs when the atria depolarise repeatedly and in an irregular uncontrolled manner, usually at an atrial rate greater than 350 bpm. No P waves are observed in the ECG as a result of the chaotic atrial depolarisation. Which of the following statements about P waves is true?

	A. The P-wave duration is normally <0.12 s - F (0.12 to 0.20s)
	B. The P-wave amplitude is normally >0.25 mV - F
	C. The P-wave contour is usually saw-toothed - F
	D. A negative P wave can indicate depolarisation arising from the bundle of His
	E. The P–R interval is the time (in seconds) from the beginning of the P wave to the end of the QRS complex - F (P to start of QRS)

#### Answer: D. A negative P wave can indicate depolarisation arising from the bundle of His - *FALSE* = A. The P-wave duration is normally < 0.12s - TRUE
- P waves are caused by atrial depolarisation. In normal sinus rhythm, the SA node acts as the pacemaker. The electrical impulse from the SA node spreads over the right and left atria to cause atrial depolarisation. The P-wave contour is usually smooth, entirely positive and of uniform size. The atrial flutter waves, known as F waves, are larger than normal P waves and they have a saw-toothed waveform. The P-wave duration is normally < 0.12 s and the amplitude is normally <0.25 mV. A negative P wave can indicate depolarisation arising from the atrioventricular (AV) node. The P–R interval is the time (in seconds) from the beginning of the P wave (onset of atrial depolarisation) to the beginning of the QRS complex (onset of ventricular depolarisation). The normal P–R interval duration range is from 0.12 s to 0.20 s, measured from the initial deflection of the P wave to the initial deflection of the QRS complex. The P–R interval is longer with high vagal tone. A prolonged P–R interval can correspond to impaired AV node conduction.

### Q2.85
A 63-yo man with severe epigastric pain and raised troponin I levels has ECG changes that suggest an acute MU involving the _inferior wall of the heart_. Which of the following ECG leads will pick up these changes?

	A. V1–V3
	B. II, III, aVF
	C. RV4, RV5
	D. I, aVL, V4–V6
	E. V1–V6

#### Answer: B: II, III, aVF - TRUE
- About half of patients have diagnostic changes on their initial ECG. An ECG should be performed on any patient who is older than 45 years and experiencing atypical or new epigastric pain or nausea. In younger patients, an ECG should be considered when suggestive symptoms are present. Younger patients are disproportionately represented in missed cases. An ECG is a rapid, low-risk, relatively low-cost measure. Results indicating high probability of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are ST-segment elevation >1mm in two contiguous leads and new Q waves. Results indicating intermediate probability of AMI are ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion, Q waves and ST T-wave abnormalities that are known to be old. Results indicating low probability of AMI are normal findings on an ECG; however, normal or non-specific findings on an ECG do not exclude the possibility of AMI.
- Localisation of AMI, based on distribution of ECG abnormalities
	- Inferior wall: II, III, aVF
	- Lateral wall: I, aVL, V4–V6
	- Anteroseptal: V1–V3
	- Anterolateral: V1–V6
	- Right ventricular: RV4, RV5
	- Posterior wall: R/S ratio >1 in V1 and V2; T-wave changes (ie upright) in V1, V8 and V9.

### Q2.86
Potassium affects the way the cell membranes work and governs the action of the heart and the pathways between brain and muscles. Which of the following statements about _potassium metabolism_ is true? 

	A. 98% of potassium is extracellular - F
	B. Total body potassium stores are approximately 100mmol/kg (7000mmol in a 70kg person)
	C. The liver determines potassium homeostasis - F
	D. Early changes of hyPERkalaemia include inverted T waves and a prolonged Q–T interval - F
	E. Acidosis results in hyPERkalaemia
 
#### Answer: E. Acidosis results in hyPERkalaemia - TRUE
- Potassium (K+) is a major ion of the body. Almost 98% of K+ is intracellular, with the concentration gradient maintained by the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. The ratio of intracellular to extracellular K+ is important in determining the cellular membrane potential. Small changes in the extracellular K+ level can have profound effects on the function of the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems. The normal K+ level is 3.5–5.0mmol/L, and total body K+ stores are about 50mmol/kg (3500mmol in a 70kg person). Potassium homeostasis is maintained predominantly through the regulation of renal excretion. The most important site of regulation is the collecting duct, where aldosterone receptors are present. Hyperkalaemia is defined as a K+ level >5.5mmol/L. Ranges are as follows:
•    5.5–6.0mmol/L – mild condition
•    6.1–7.0mmol/L – moderate condition
•    >7.0mmol/L – severe condition
 
Hyperkalaemia results from the following:
•    Decreased or impaired K+ excretion: as observed with acute or chronic renal failure (most common), potassium-sparing diuretics, urinary obstruction, sickle cell disease, Addison’s disease and systemic lupus erythematosus (SlE).
•    Additions of K+ into extracellular space: as observed with potassium supplements (eg oral and intravenous potassium, salt substitutes), rhabdomyolysis and haemolysis (eg venepuncture, blood transfusions, burns, tumour lysis).
•    Transmembrane shifts (ie shifting potassium from the intracellular to extracellular space): as observed with acidosis and medication effects (eg acute digitalis toxicity, blockers, suxamethonium).
•    Fictitious or pseudohyperkalaemia: as observed with improper blood collection (eg ischaemic blood draw from venepuncture technique), laboratory error, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis.
 
An ECG is essential and may be instrumental in diagnosing hyperkalaemia in the appropriate clinical setting. ECG changes have a sequential progression of effects, which roughly correlate with the potassium level. ECG findings may be observed as follows: early changes of hyperkalaemia include peaked T waves, shortened Q–T interval and ST segment depression. These changes are followed by bundle-branch blocks causing a widening of the QRS complex, increases in the P–R interval and decreased amplitude of the P wave. These changes reverse with appropriate treatment. Without treatment, the P wave eventually disappears and the QRS morphology widens to resemble a sine wave. Ventricular fibrillation or asystole follows. ECG findings generally correlate with the potassium level, but potentially life-threatening arrhythmias can occur without warning at almost any level of hyperkalaemia.

### Q2.87
A phospholipase is an enzyme that converts phospholipids into fatty acids and other lipophilic substances. There are 4 major classes, termed A, B, c and D. Phospholipase c acts as a secondary messenger. 

Which of the following statements about _phospholipase c_ is true?
		
	A. It frees a fatty acid bound in an ester linkage to carbon-2 of glycerol
	B. Its activity is stimulated by hormone–receptor interactions coupled to a Gp protein
	C. It initiates a cascade, resulting in the activation of protein kinase A
	D. It initiates a cascade, resulting in the activation of guanylyl kinase
	E. It initiates a cascade, resulting in the activation of tyrosine kinase
	
#### Answer: E. It initiates a cascade, resulting in the activation of tyrosine kinase - *FALSE* = A. It frees a fatty acid bound in an ester linkage to carbon-2 of glycerol - TRUE
- Phospholipase C is activated by hormones with receptors that are coupled to a pG protein. It converts phosphatidyl inositol to inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) by cleaving the phosphoester bond between carbon-3 of glycerol and inositol-4,5-bisphosphate on phosphatidylinositol diphosphate. IP3 and DAG can act on other proteins in cells to increase the activity of enzymes, eg protein kinase C, or on membrane channels such as calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in smooth muscle. Phospholipase C does not directly stimulate reactions that affect activity of protein kinase A, tyrosine kinase or guanylyl cyclase. Phospholipases A2 are a large family of enzymes that specifically deacylate fatty acids from the second carbon atom of the triglyceride backbone of phospholipids, producing a free fatty acid and a lysophospholipid.

### Q2.88
Oedema is defined as an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the tissues or cavities of the body. Oedema may be *mechanical* - the result of obstructed veins or heart failure (HF) - or caused by *increased permeability* of the capillary walls, as in liver or kidney disease or malnutrition. 

In the table below which of the physiological derangements will result in _pitting oedema_ and a _decrease in plasma osmolality_?

	| Gain/Loss	| Total body fluid	| Total body sodium	|
----|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
A	| LOSS		| Marked decrease 	| Decrease
B	| GAIN		| Marked increase	| Increase
C	| GAIN		| Increase			| Increase
D	| GAIN		| Increase			| Marked increase
E	| LOSS		| Decrease			| Marked decrease
	
#### Answer: NO CLUE = B | GAIN	| Marked increase | Increase - TRUE
- Pitting oedema is always associated with the retention of sodium and occurs when >3 litres of interstitial fluid collects. As sodium is limited to the ECF compartment, an excess in total body sodium results in pitting oedema caused by the greater volume of the interstitial space compared with the vascular compartment. Therefore, to reduce the plasma osmolality and produce pitting oedema, there must be a greater gain in water than in sodium.

### Q2.89
The total body sodium content is regulated by a balance between dietary intake and renal excretion. Which of the following statement about _sodium metabolism_ is true?

	A. Sodium concentration is highest in the intracellular fluid - F
	B. Active transport of sodium across all cells consumes most of the energy derived from cellular metabolism - F
	C. Sodium reabsorption across proximal tubular cells is mainly active and transcellular - F
	D. Sodium concentration gradient provides energy for the co-transport of H+ - F
	E. Transport of sodium across the apical membrane of the nephron is an active transport process
	
#### Answer: E. Transport of sodium across the apical membrane of the nephron is an active transport process - *FALSE* = C. Sodium reabsorption across proximal tubular cells is mainly active and transcellular - TRUE
- Sodium is the major osmotically active cation in the ECF compartment. Most of the proximal reabsorption of Na+ occurs by active transport and is transcellular. The transcellular pathway consists of the apical and basolateral membranes. The Na+/K+ ATPase pump in all cell membranes is responsible for active Na+ transport (efflux) and active K+ transport (influx). This enzyme maintains the low intracellular Na+ concentration and the high extracellular Na+ concentration. Active transport consumes 30–50% of the energy derived from metabolism in most cells. Although the influx of sodium from the tubular lumen to the proximal tubular cell is in the direction favoured by the electrochemical potential, this transport is mediated by specific membrane carrier proteins and not by simple diffusion. These membrane proteins couple the active movement of other solutes to the passive movement of Na+. Examples include Na+-glucose and Na+-amino acid symporters and a Na+ antiporter. In each case the potential energy released by downhill transport of Na+ is used to power the uphill transport of the other substance. These transport systems are referred to as Na+-coupled, secondary, active transport processes. It is important to remember that reabsorption includes not only Na+ influx from the tubular lumen but also active transport of Na+ out of the cell into the bloodstream.

### Q2.90 - LEARN
The evaluation of the _jugular venous pulse_ (JVP) is an integral part of the physical examination because it reflects both the mean right atrial pressure and the haemodynamic events in the right atrium. Which of the following statement about the JVP waveform is true?

	A. The 'a' wave is caused by right ventricular contraction - F (right atrium)
	B. The 'c' wave is the most prominent during inspiration
	C. The 'x' descent results from the increase in blood volume in the vena cava and the right atrium during ventricular systole when the tricuspid valve is closed
	D. The 'v' wave is a result of the downward displacement of the tricuspid valve during right ventricular systole - F (upward displacement) 
	E. The 'y' descent is caused by opening of the tricuspid valve

#### Answer: C. The 'x' descent results from the increase in blood volume in the vena cava and the right atrium during ventricular systole when the tricuspid valve is closed - *FALSE* = E. The 'y' descent is caused by opening of the tricuspid valve - TRUE
- The normal jugular venous pulse (JVP) reflects phasic pressure changes in the right atrium and consists of three positive waves and two negative troughs. The positive presystolic ‘a’ wave is produced by right atrial contraction and is the dominant wave in the JVP particularly during inspiration. During atrial relaxation, the venous pulse descends from the summit of the ‘a’ wave. Depending on the P–R interval, this descent may continue until a plateau (‘z’ point) is reached just before right ventricular systole. More often the descent is interrupted by a second positive venous or ‘c’ wave, which is produced by a bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium during right ventricular isovolumic systole and by the impact of the carotid artery adjacent to the jugular vein. Following the summit of the ‘c’ wave, the JVP contour declines, forming the normal negative systolic wave, the ‘x’ trough. The ‘x’ descent is a result of a combination of atrial relaxation, the downward displacement of the tricuspid valve during right ventricular systole and the ejection of blood from both the ventricles. The positive, late systolic ‘v’ wave in the JVP results from the increase in blood volume in the vena cavae and the right atrium during ventricular systole when the tricuspid valve is closed. After the peak of the ‘v’ wave is reached, the right atrial pressure decreases because of the diminished bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium and the decline in right ventricular pressure that follow tricuspid valve opening. The latter occurs at the peak of the ‘v’ wave in the JVP.
- Following the summit of the ‘v’ wave, there is a negative descending limb, referred to as the ‘y’ descent or diastolic collapse, which is caused by the opening of the tricuspid valve and flow of blood into the right ventricle. The initial ‘y’ descent corresponds to the right ventricular rapid filling phase. The trough of the ‘y’ wave occurs in early diastole and is followed by the ascending limb of the ‘y’ wave, which is produced by continued diastolic inflow of blood into the right side of the heart. The velocity of this ascending pressure curve depends on the rate of venous return and the distensibility of the chambers of the right side of the heart. When diastole is long, the descending limb of the ‘y’ wave is often followed by a small, brief, positive wave, the ‘h’ wave, which occurs just before the next ‘a’ wave. At times, there is a plateau phase rather than a distinct ‘h’ wave. With increasing pulse rate the ‘y’ trough and the ‘y’ ascent are followed immediately by the next ‘a’ wave. Usually, there are three visible major positive waves (‘a’, ‘c’, ‘v’) and two negative troughs (‘x’, ‘y’) when the pulse rate is below 90 beats/min and the P–R interval is normal. With faster heart rates there is often fusion of some of the pulse waves and an accurate analysis of the waveform is more difficult.
