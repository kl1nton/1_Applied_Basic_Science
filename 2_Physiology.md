### Q2.1
A 63-year-old man’s blood pressure was high as he wrongly omitted taking his antihypertensive medication on the day of surgery. An _increase in systemic blood pressure_ leads to which one of the following effects?

	A. A decrease in the maximal wall tension in the left ventricle
	B. A decrease in the time it takes for the left ventricular wall to develop peak tension
	C. An increase in cardiac output
	D. An increase in the residual volume of blood in the left ventricle
	E. An increase in the velocity at which blood is ejected from the left ventricle

#### Answer: D. An increase in the residual volume of blood in the left ventricle - TRUE
- An increase in the systemic pressure (ie, the afterload that the ventricle must overcome) reduces the velocity of shortening of contractile elements in the muscle. An increase in afterload also reduces the extent of muscle shortening, which results in a decreased stroke volume and consequently, an increased residual volume (ie, the volume of blood left in the ventricles at the end of ejection).
- The time that it takes for the left ventricular wall to develop peak tension is not reduced because the velocity of contraction is reduced and the peak tension is increased. Wall tension is a function of the product of ventricular pressure and volume. Because pressure and volume are increased, wall tension also is increased in the presence of an increased afterload.

### Q2.2
A 26-year-old man involved in road traffic accident is brought to the Emergency Department with considerable blood loss from his fractured right femur. He is given transfusion to increase the preload of the cardiac muscle. Increasing the _preload_:

	A. Decreases the initial velocity of shortening of the cardiac muscle
	B. Decreases the time it takes the muscle to reach peak tension
	C. Increases the ventricular wall tension
	D. Reduces the peak tension of the muscle
	E. Reduces the ventricular end-diastolic pressure

#### Answer: C. Increases the ventricular wall tension - TRUE
- Increasing the cardiac muscle preload increases the ventricular wall tension. An increase in both end-diastolic pressure and volume is synonymous with an increased preload. The increased preload causes a more forceful ventricular contraction, which results in an increase in the peak pressure generated by the ventricle as well as an increase in the stroke volume. This intrinsic property of the myocardium is termed the Frank Starling mechanism. The increased preload results in an increased velocity of shortening, but because the peak pressure increases, the time to peak pressure usually remains constant under these conditions.

### Q2.3
A 22-year-old athlete is running the London marathon. Which one of the following mechanisms is the _most important for maintaining increased blood flow_ to this athlete’s skeletal muscles?

	A. An increase in aortic pressure
	B. An increase in -adrenergic impulses
	C. An increase in -adrenergic impulses
	D. Vasoconstriction in the splanchnic and renal areas
	E. Vasodilation secondary to the effects of local metabolites

#### Answer: E. Vasodilation secondary to the effects of local metabolites - TRUE

### Q2.4
A patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoes measurement of his lung volumes and capacities prior to undergoing major abdominal surgery. The volume of gas in his lungs at the end of a normal expiration is referred to as the:

	A. Expiratory reserve volume (ERV)
	B. Functional residual capacity (FRC)
	C. Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV)
	D. Residual volume (RV)
	E. Total lung capacity (TLC)
	
#### Answer: B. Functional residual capacity (FRC) - TRUE
- The functional residual capacity (FRC) is the volume of gas in the lungs at the end of normal expiration. Since expiration is passive, the lung volume decreases during expiration until the equilibrium volume (ie, the FRC) is reached. The equilibrium volume represents the volume of a distensible structure when the transmural pressure (ie, the pressure inside minus the pressure outside) is zero. The residual volume is the volume of gas in the lungs following maximal expiration. The expiratory reserve volume is the volume of gas that can be forcefully expired after normal expiration, and the inspiratory reserve volume is the additional volume gas that can be inspired over the tidal volume. The total lung capacity is the volume of gas in the lungs after maximal inspiration.

### Q2.5
Following extubation, ABG analysis of a patient showed raised PaCO2 levels. _HyPERcapnia affects respiration_ primarily by stimulating the:

	A. Arterial baroreceptors
	B. Carotid and aortic bodies
	C. Central (medullary) chemoreceptors
	D. Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)
	E. J receptors
	
#### Answer: B. Carotid and aortic bodies - *FALSE* = C. Central (medullary) chemoreceptors - TRUE
- Approximately 85% of the effect of CO2 on the respiratory drive is mediated through the central (medullary) chemoreceptors; only 15% of the effect comes from the carotid and aortic bodies (ie, the peripheral chemoreceptors). CO2 readily crosses the blood–brain barrier, but charged ions (ie, H+) do not. The hydration and subsequent dissociation of CO2 into H+ and HCO3– after it crosses the blood– brain barrier increases the H+ concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the brain tissues stimulating respiration. J receptors, arterial baroreceptors, and the hypoglossal nerve are not affected by changes in CO2.

### Q2.6
A 47-year-old man who is breathing air at sea level has a respiratory exchange ratio of 1. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals: pH = 7.52, PaO2 = 85 mmHg (11.3 kPa), and PaCO2 = 30 mmHg (4.0 kPa). This patient’s arterial blood gas analysis is suggestive of which one of the following?

	A. He has been hypoventilating
	B. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
	C. He has metabolic alkalosis
	D. His alveolar-to-arterial O2 tension difference exceeds 20 mmHg
	E. His plasma bicarbonate levels are increased

#### Answer: E. His plasma bicarbonate levels are increased - *FALSE* = D. His alveolar-to-arterial O2 tension difference exceeds 20 mmHg - TRUE
- pH: alkalotic; PaO2: normal; PaCO2: **LOW** = Respiratory Alkalosis
- This patient has an alveolar-to-arterial O2 tension difference of 35mmHg. To calculate this, the alveolar O2 tension (PAo2) must be determined using the alveolar gas equation. Given an arterial CO2 tension of 30mmHg, the alveolar O2 tension is determined as:
- PaO2 = (760 – 47) × 0.21 – 30 = 150 – 30 = 120mmHg
- Thus, the alveolar-to-arterial O2 tension difference is 120 – 85, or 35mmHg. This patient’s low arterial CO2 tension and high pH indicate that he has respiratory alkalosis, and he has been hyperventilating and does not have metabolic alkalosis. Respiratory alkalosis causes a decrease in plasma bicarbonate levels due to the slope of the blood buffer line. Lastly, COPD leads to hypoxia and CO2 retention, not hyperventilation.

### Q2.7
Which one of the following acid-base changes is characteristic of hyPERventilation?

	A. Plasma pH = 7.27, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 37, urine pH = acid
	B. Plasma pH = 7.31, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 16, urine pH = acid
	C. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 15, urine pH = alkaline
	D. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 24, urine pH = acid
	E. Plasma pH = 7.55, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 22, urine pH = alkaline
	
#### Answer: E. Plasma pH = 7.55, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 22, urine pH = alkaline - *FALSE* = C. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 15, urine pH = alkaline - TRUE
- HyPERventilation: **L** PaCO2 = **H** pH (> 7.45); normal HCO3- (21-28 mEq/L) → E
- Hyperventilation is defined as alveolar ventilation in excess of the body’s needs for CO2 elimination, which results in decreased arterial CO2 tension – the underlying factor in respiratory alkalosis. Although CO2 tension is not given it can be calculated using the mathematical relationship: [HCO3–]/S.Paco2 = 20/1. Applying this equation, it is clear that the value in set C indicate a decrease in CO2 tension:
- 15/S.PaCO2 = 20/1, or S.PaCO2 = 0.75mmol/L
	- Because: S.PaCO2 = 0.75mmol/L
	- And: S = 0.03mmol/L/mmHg,
	- Then: PaCO2 = 0.75/0.03 = 25mmHg
- A CO2 tension of 25mmHg is significantly lower than normal (40mmHg). In acute respiratory alkalosis, there is a decrease in urinary H+ excretion and an increase in urinary HCO3– excretion. In this case, there has been complete renal compensation, as evidenced by the return of the [HCO3–]/S.Paco2 ratio to normal (20:1).

### Q2.8
Which one of the following acid-base changes is characteristic of _chronic respiratory tract obstruction_ by a tracheal tumour?

	A. Plasma pH = 7.27, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 37, urine pH = acid
	B. Plasma pH = 7.31, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 16, urine pH = acid
	C. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 15, urine pH = alkaline
	D. Plasma pH = 7.40, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 24, urine pH = acid
	E. Plasma pH = 7.55, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 22, urine pH = alkaline
	
#### Answer: A. Plasma pH = 7.27, plasma HCO3– (mEq/L) = 37, urine pH = acid - TRUE
- COPD: **H** CO2 = **L** pH (< 7.35); chronic = compensation = high HCO3- (>28 mEq/L) → A
- In chronic respiratory tract obstruction (eg, due to tracheal stenosis or tumour), alveolar ventilation is insufficient to excrete CO2 at a rate required by the body, which leads to increased arterial CO2 tension – the underlying factor in respiratory acidosis. The kidney increases H+ secretion, resulting in the addition of HCO3– to the extracellular fluid. The values in set A correspond with these changes. In this case, there is partial compensation of the respiratory acidosis as evidenced by the increase in [HCO3–]. In chronic respiratory acidosis, the respiratory centre become less sensitive to hypercapnia and acidosis and relies on the associated hypoxemia as the primary drive to ventilation. Correction of the low O2 tension by the administration of O2 will diminish respiratory drive, resulting in hypoventilation, a further increase in CO2 tension, and possibly CO2 narcosis. For this reason, O2 must be given with extreme caution to patients with chronic hypercapnia.

### Q2.9
Which one of the following is most likely to _increase the glomerular filtration rate_ (GFR)?

	A. Decreased net filtration pressure
	B. Increased arterial plasma oncotic pressure
	C. Increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure
	D. Increased hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s capsule - F
	E. Vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole - F
	
#### Answer: C. Increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure - TRUE
- The major determinant of the GFR is the hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus. An increase in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure is a major force that drives fluid out of the glomerular capillary and into Bowman’s capsule. In glomerular capillaries, the net movement of fluid is primarily out of the capillaries, whereas in systemic capillaries, the change in balance of Starling forces is such that net movement out of the capillaries is nearly balanced by net return of fluid into the vessels. Increases in the plasma oncotic pressure, hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s space, and afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction decrease the GFR, as does a decrease in the net filtration pressure.

### Q2.10
Which one of the following is most likely to be seen in a 48-year-old woman who presented to the Emergency Department with _severe vomiting secondary to pyloric obstruction_?

	A. Acid urine - F
	B. A decrease in arterial CO2 tension - F
	C. An increase in alveolar ventilation - F
	D. An increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration
	E. HyPERchloraemia - F
	
#### Answer: D. An increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration - TRUE
- The severe loss of gastric fluid in this patient would produce metabolic alkalosis due to loss of HCl (a non-carbonic acid). She also would have hypovolaemia due to the fluid loss. The development of alkalosis is sensed by the chemoreceptors controlling ventilation, resulting in hypoventilation, and an increase in the arterial CO2 tension (hypercapnia), which reduces the pH towards normal. The kidneys would be expected to excrete the excess bicarbonate, raising the urinary pH.
