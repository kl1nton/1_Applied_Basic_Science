#### Answer: C. Omphalocele - *FALSE* = D. Umbilical fistula - TRUE
- In the human embryo, the vitelline duct, also known as the omphalomesenteric duct, is a long narrow tube that joins the yolk sac to the digestive tube. It appears at the end of the fourth week, when the yolk sac presents the appearance of a small pear-shaped vesicle (the umbilical vesicle). 
- As a rule the duct undergoes complete obliteration during the seventh week, but in about 2% of cases its proximal part persists as a diverticulum from the small intestine, Meckel’s diverticulum, which is situated about 60cm above the ileocaecal junction, and may be attached by a fibrous cord to the abdominal wall at the umbilicus
- Sometimes a narrowing of the lumen of the ileum is seen opposite the site of attachment of the duct. If the duct remains patent over its entire length, a direct communication called the umbilical fistula is formed between the umbilicus and the intestinal tract.


Questions 1.21-1.30
-------------------

40% - F: 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 30

### Q1.21
A 22-year-old man is stabbed in the axilla. There is profuse bleeding from the axillary artery. Which of the following statements about the _axillary artery_ is true?

	A. It originates from the arch of the aorta - F
	B. It gives origin to the thoracoacromial artery
	C. It has the lateral thoracic artery as its first branch
	D. It divides into radial and ulnar arteries in the cubital fossa - F
	E. It provides no blood supply to the humerus - F

#### Answer: B. It gives origin to the thoracoacromial artery - TRUE
- The axillary artery, the continuation of the subclavian, commences at the outer border of the first rib and ends at the lower border of the tendon of teres major, where it takes the name of brachial. At its origin the artery is very deeply situated, but near its termination it is superficial, being covered only by skin and fascia. To facilitate the description of the vessel it is divided into three portions: the first lies above, the second behind and the third below pectoralis minor. The branches of the axillary artery are: from the first part, the superior thoracic artery; from the second part, the thoracoacromial artery and lateral thoracic artery; and from the third part, the subscapular artery, posterior humeral circumflex artery and anterior humeral circumflex artery. The anterior and posterior circumflex humeral branches supply the humerus.

### Q1.22
A man stabbed in a bar fight suffers a _penetrating wound through the anterior axillary fold_, with resulting damage to one of the _main terminal branches of the brachial plexus_. Clinical examination in the Emergency Department revealed a significant weakening of flexion of the elbow. The other effect to be expected is:

	A. Loss of cutaneous sensation on the tips of several fingers
	B. Loss of cutaneous sensation just on the anterolateral surface of the forearm
	C. Just weakening of flexion at the shoulder
	D. Weakening of flexion at the shoulder and loss of cutaneous sensation on the anterolateral surface of the arm
	E. Weakening of flexion at the shoulder and loss of cutaneous sensation on the anterolateral surface of the forearm
 
#### Answer: B. Loss of cutaneous sensation just on the anterolateral surface of the forearm - *FALSE* = E. Weakening of flexion at the shoulder and loss of cutaneous sensation on the anterolateral surface of the forearm - TRUE
- Flexion at the elbow is produced by biceps brachii and brachialis; both of these muscles are innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve, so it is evident that the musculocutaneous nerve has been damaged. Beyond innervating the muscles that flex the forearm, the musculocutaneous nerve gives off the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve that provides sensory innervation to the anterolateral surface of the forearm. This means that the other symptom that would be present is a loss of cutaneous sensation on the anterolateral surface of the forearm. The biceps brachii and coracobrachialis muscles flex the arm, so there should be weakening of flexion at the shoulder, although function of pectoralis major, a powerful arm flexor, must still be intact.

### Q1.23

	A. Teres major muscle
	B. Teres minor muscle
	C. Deltoid muscle - F
	D. Supraspinatus muscle - F
	E. Infraspinatus muscle - F

#### Answer: B. Teres minor muscle - *FALSE* = A. Teres major muscle - TRUE
- The lower subscapular nerve (C5, C6) supplies the lower part of subscapularis and ends in teres major
	- the latter is sometimes supplied by a separate branch
- Teres minor and deltoid are supplied by the axillary nerve
	- The suprascapular nerve innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles.

### Q1.24
A 62-year-old woman has a loop of bowel herniating into the _femoral canal_. Which of the following statements best describes the femoral canal?

	A. It is superficial to the inguinal ligament
	B. It transmits the obturator nerve
	C. It is the medial compartment of the femoral sheath
	D. It transmits the femoral artery
	E. It is lateral to the femoral nerve 

#### Answer: C. It is the medial compartment of the femoral sheath - TRUE
- The femoral sheath is divided by two vertical partitions that stretch between its anterior and posterior walls. The lateral compartment contains the femoral artery, and the intermediate compartment contains the femoral vein, whereas the medial and smallest compartment is named the femoral canal, and contains some lymphatic vessels and a lymph gland embedded in a small amount of areolar tissue. The femoral canal is conical and measures about 1.25cm in length.

### Q1.25
Clinical examination of a patient with a diabetic ulcer in the anterior midline of the ankle region elicited _loss of cutaneous sensation on the dorsal surface of the foot_. Which nerve was most probably damaged?

	A. Femoral
	B. Lateral sural cutaneous
	C. Saphenous
	D. Sural
	E. Superficial peroneal
	
#### Answer: B. Lateral sural cutaneous - *FALSE* = E. Superficial peroneal - TRUE
- The superficial peroneal nerve provides cutaneous innervation to the lower anterior third of the leg and the dorsum of the foot. It reaches the dorsum of the foot by crossing over the anterior midline of the ankle region. Both the area of injury and the subsequent symptoms should point to damage of the superficial peroneal nerve. The femoral nerve is mostly important as a motor nerve – it innervates quadriceps femoris, sartorius and pectineus. Its anterior femoral cutaneous branches provide sensory innervation to the medial and anterior thigh. Another branch of the femoral nerve, the saphenous nerve, provides sensory innervation to the medial side of the leg and foot. The lateral sural cutaneous nerve is a branch of the common peroneal nerve providing sensory innervation to the skin of the lateral side of the leg. The sural nerve, which runs down the posterior leg with the lesser saphenous vein, provides sensory innervation to the posterior surface of the lower leg and the lateral side of the foot.

### Q1.26
A 20-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with features suggestive of _common peroneal nerve injury_. The common peroneal nerve is most commonly injured:
	
	A. Where it emerges below the piriformis muscle
	B. At the site where it divides into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves
	C. Where it leaves the sciatic nerve in the popliteal fossa
	D. As it branches into the head of the biceps femoris
	E. Just behind the head of the fibula

#### Answer: E. Just behind the head of the fibula - TRUE
- Peroneal neuropathies are classically associated with external compression at the level of the fibular head. The most common aetiology is habitual leg crossing (which compresses this area). Prolonged positioning with pressure at this area (eg sitting on an airplane or positioning during surgery) are other causes. Short casts or braces around this area can be factors in external compression. Other causes include operative trauma (knee surgery), fibular fracture, blunt or open trauma, and intrinsic masses (eg ganglionic cysts, schwannoma). Lack or loss of the fat pad over the fibular head as a result of sudden weight loss and/or a thin body habitus predisposes the nerve to external compression at this site.

### Q1.27
A 2-year-old baby developed chylothorax as a result of iatrogenic injury to the thoracic duct at the time of surgery to correct a congenital cardiac defect. Which of the following statements about the _thoracic duct_ is true?

	A. It returns lymph from the convex surface of the liver
	B. It extends from the fifth lumbar vertebra to the root of the neck
	C. It enters the thorax through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm
	D. It ends by opening into the angle of junction of the right subclavian vein with the right internal jugular vein 
	E. It has no valves to ensure smooth flow of lymph
	
#### Answer: D. It ends by opening into the angle of junction of the right subclavian vein with the right internal jugular vein - *FALSE* = C. It enters the thorax through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm - TRUE
- The thoracic duct conveys the greater part of the lymph and chyle into the blood. It is the common trunk of all the lymphatic vessels of the body, except those on the right side of the head, neck and thorax, and right upper extremity, the right lung, right side of the heart and convex surface of the liver. In the adult it varies in length from 38 to 45cm and extends from the second lumbar vertebra to the root of the neck. It begins in the abdomen by a triangular dilatation, the cisterna chyli, which is situated on the front of the body of the second lumbar vertebra, to the right side of and behind the aorta, and by the side of the right crus of the diaphragm. It enters the thorax through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm, and ascends through the posterior mediastinal cavity between the aorta and the azygos vein. It ends by opening into the angle of junction of the left subclavian vein with the left internal jugular vein. The thoracic duct has several valves; at its termination it is provided with a pair, the free borders of which are turned towards the vein, so as to prevent the passage of venous blood into the duct.

### Q1.28
A patient with _acute anal fissure_ has severe pain. The pain sensations in this condition are transmitted by:

	A. The superior rectal nerve
	B. The inferior rectal nerve
	C. The pelvic splanchnic nerve
	D. The perineal nerve
	E. The posterior scrotal nerve

#### Answer: C. The pelvic splanchnic nerve - *FALSE* = B. The inferior rectal nerve - TRUE
- The anal canal below the pectinate line is supplied by the inferior rectal nerve (S2, S3, S4) and is responsible for the transmission of pain sensation. Anal fissure is caused by the rupture of one of the anal valves, usually by the passage of dry hard stool in someone who is constipated. Each valve is lined by mucous membrane above and skin below. As a result of skin involvement, the condition is extremely painful and associated with marked spasm of the anal sphincters.

### Q1.29

	B. A lacunar ligament - F
	C. Reflected inguinal ligament - F
	D. Union of the transversalis fascia with the inguinal ligament - F
	E. Arched fibres of internal oblique and transversus abdominis

#### Answer: E. Arched fibres of internal oblique and transversus abdominis - TRUE
- The inguinal canal is an oblique canal about 4cm long, slanting downwards and medially, and in parallel with and a little above the inguinal ligament; it extends from the deep inguinal ring to the superficial inguinal ring. It is bounded by the integument and superficial fascia in front, by the aponeurosis of the external oblique throughout its whole length and by the internal oblique in its lateral third. It is bounded by: behind, the reflected inguinal ligament, the inguinal aponeurotic falx, the transversalis fascia, the extraperitoneal connective tissue and the peritoneum; above, the arched fibres of internal oblique and transversus abdominis; below, the union of the transversalis fascia with the inguinal ligament; and at its medial end, the lacunar ligament. The inguinal canal contains the spermatic cord and the ilioinguinal nerve in the male, and the round ligament of the uterus and the ilioinguinal nerve in the female.

### Q1.30
During mobilisation of the descending aorta for repair of coarctation of aorta, a surgeon accidentally cuts the _first aortic intercostal artery_. Which of the following structures might be deprived of its main source of blood supply?

	A. First posterior intercostal space
	B. First anterior intercostal space
	C. Right bronchus
	D. Left bronchus
	E. Fibrous pericardium
 
#### Answer: A. First posterior intercostal space - *FALSE* = C. Right bronchus - TRUE
- The right bronchus receives blood from a single right bronchial artery. This artery may branch from one of the left bronchial arteries or from the right third posterior intercostal artery, the first intercostal artery that arises from the descending aorta. Damage of this artery might stop the blood supply to the main bronchus. The intercostal arteries to the first and second intercostal spaces are derived from the highest intercostal artery, so the blood supply to either of these spaces would not be disrupted. The left bronchus is supplied by two left bronchial arteries that branch directly from the descending aorta. The fibrous pericardium is a fibrous sac containing the pericardial cavity and the heart. Its blood supply is not a major concern, and is via branches from the internal mammary and musculophrenic arteries as well as from the descending thoracic aorta.

### Q1.31
The thoracoabdominal diaphragm is pierced by three large apertures for the passage of the aorta, vena cava and oesophagus between the thorax and abdomen. Which of the following statements about these *openings in the diaphragm* is true?
	
	A. The aortic hiatus is the highest and most anterior of the large apertures
	B. The aortic hiatus is in the central tendon
	C. The oesophageal hiatus is at the level of the ninth thoracic vertebra
	D. The vena caval foramen is quadrilateral in shape
	E. The vena caval foramen transmits some branches of the left phrenic nerve
	
#### Answer: E. The vena caval foramen transmits some branches of the left phrenic nerve - *FALSE* = D. The vena caval foramen is quadrilateral in shape - TRUE
- The diaphragm is pierced by a series of apertures to permit the passage of structures between the thorax and abdomen. Three large openings include the aortic, oesophageal and vena caval openings. The aortic hiatus is the lowest and most posterior of the large apertures; it lies at the level of the twelfth thoracic vertebra. Strictly speaking, it is not an aperture in the diaphragm but an osseo-aponeurotic opening between it and the vertebral column, and it is therefore behind the diaphragm. The aorta, azygos vein and thoracic duct pass through it; occasionally the azygos vein is transmitted via the right crus. The oesophageal hiatus is situated in the muscular part of the diaphragm at the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra; it is elliptical in shape. It is placed above, in front of and a little to the left of the aortic hiatus, and transmits the oesophagus, the vagus nerves and some small oesophageal arteries. The vena caval foramen is the highest of the three, and is situated at about the level of the fibrocartilage between the eighth and ninth thoracic vertebrae. It is quadrilateral in form, and is placed at the junction of the right and middle leaflets of the central tendon, so that its margins are tendinous. It transmits the inferior vena cava (IVC), the wall of which is adherent to the margins of the opening, and some branches of the right phrenic nerve.
