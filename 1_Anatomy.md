#### Answer: C. Omphalocele - *FALSE* = D. Umbilical fistula - TRUE
- In the human embryo, the vitelline duct, also known as the omphalomesenteric duct, is a long narrow tube that joins the yolk sac to the digestive tube. It appears at the end of the fourth week, when the yolk sac presents the appearance of a small pear-shaped vesicle (the umbilical vesicle). 
- As a rule the duct undergoes complete obliteration during the seventh week, but in about 2% of cases its proximal part persists as a diverticulum from the small intestine, Meckel’s diverticulum, which is situated about 60cm above the ileocaecal junction, and may be attached by a fibrous cord to the abdominal wall at the umbilicus
- Sometimes a narrowing of the lumen of the ileum is seen opposite the site of attachment of the duct. If the duct remains patent over its entire length, a direct communication called the umbilical fistula is formed between the umbilicus and the intestinal tract.


Questions 1.21-1.30
-------------------

40% - F: 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 30

### Q1.21
A 22-year-old man is stabbed in the axilla. There is profuse bleeding from the axillary artery. Which of the following statements about the _axillary artery_ is true?

	A. It originates from the arch of the aorta - F
	B. It gives origin to the thoracoacromial artery
	C. It has the lateral thoracic artery as its first branch
	D. It divides into radial and ulnar arteries in the cubital fossa - F
	E. It provides no blood supply to the humerus - F

#### Answer: B. It gives origin to the thoracoacromial artery - TRUE
- The axillary artery, the continuation of the subclavian, commences at the outer border of the first rib and ends at the lower border of the tendon of teres major, where it takes the name of brachial. At its origin the artery is very deeply situated, but near its termination it is superficial, being covered only by skin and fascia. To facilitate the description of the vessel it is divided into three portions: the first lies above, the second behind and the third below pectoralis minor. The branches of the axillary artery are: from the first part, the superior thoracic artery; from the second part, the thoracoacromial artery and lateral thoracic artery; and from the third part, the subscapular artery, posterior humeral circumflex artery and anterior humeral circumflex artery. The anterior and posterior circumflex humeral branches supply the humerus.

### Q1.22
A man stabbed in a bar fight suffers a _penetrating wound through the anterior axillary fold_, with resulting damage to one of the _main terminal branches of the brachial plexus_. Clinical examination in the Emergency Department revealed a significant weakening of flexion of the elbow. The other effect to be expected is:

	A. Loss of cutaneous sensation on the tips of several fingers
	B. Loss of cutaneous sensation just on the anterolateral surface of the forearm
	C. Just weakening of flexion at the shoulder
	D. Weakening of flexion at the shoulder and loss of cutaneous sensation on the anterolateral surface of the arm
	E. Weakening of flexion at the shoulder and loss of cutaneous sensation on the anterolateral surface of the forearm
 
#### Answer: B. Loss of cutaneous sensation just on the anterolateral surface of the forearm - *FALSE* = E. Weakening of flexion at the shoulder and loss of cutaneous sensation on the anterolateral surface of the forearm - TRUE
- Flexion at the elbow is produced by biceps brachii and brachialis; both of these muscles are innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve, so it is evident that the musculocutaneous nerve has been damaged. Beyond innervating the muscles that flex the forearm, the musculocutaneous nerve gives off the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve that provides sensory innervation to the anterolateral surface of the forearm. This means that the other symptom that would be present is a loss of cutaneous sensation on the anterolateral surface of the forearm. The biceps brachii and coracobrachialis muscles flex the arm, so there should be weakening of flexion at the shoulder, although function of pectoralis major, a powerful arm flexor, must still be intact.

### Q1.23

	A. Teres major muscle
	B. Teres minor muscle
	C. Deltoid muscle - F
	D. Supraspinatus muscle - F
	E. Infraspinatus muscle - F

#### Answer: B. Teres minor muscle - *FALSE* = A. Teres major muscle - TRUE
- The lower subscapular nerve (C5, C6) supplies the lower part of subscapularis and ends in teres major
	- the latter is sometimes supplied by a separate branch
- Teres minor and deltoid are supplied by the axillary nerve
	- The suprascapular nerve innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles.

### Q1.24
A 62-year-old woman has a loop of bowel herniating into the _femoral canal_. Which of the following statements best describes the femoral canal?

	A. It is superficial to the inguinal ligament
	B. It transmits the obturator nerve
	C. It is the medial compartment of the femoral sheath
	D. It transmits the femoral artery
	E. It is lateral to the femoral nerve 

#### Answer: C. It is the medial compartment of the femoral sheath - TRUE
- The femoral sheath is divided by two vertical partitions that stretch between its anterior and posterior walls. The lateral compartment contains the femoral artery, and the intermediate compartment contains the femoral vein, whereas the medial and smallest compartment is named the femoral canal, and contains some lymphatic vessels and a lymph gland embedded in a small amount of areolar tissue. The femoral canal is conical and measures about 1.25cm in length.

### Q1.25
Clinical examination of a patient with a diabetic ulcer in the anterior midline of the ankle region elicited _loss of cutaneous sensation on the dorsal surface of the foot_. Which nerve was most probably damaged?

	A. Femoral
	B. Lateral sural cutaneous
	C. Saphenous
	D. Sural
	E. Superficial peroneal
	
#### Answer: B. Lateral sural cutaneous - *FALSE* = E. Superficial peroneal - TRUE
- The superficial peroneal nerve provides cutaneous innervation to the lower anterior third of the leg and the dorsum of the foot. It reaches the dorsum of the foot by crossing over the anterior midline of the ankle region. Both the area of injury and the subsequent symptoms should point to damage of the superficial peroneal nerve. The femoral nerve is mostly important as a motor nerve – it innervates quadriceps femoris, sartorius and pectineus. Its anterior femoral cutaneous branches provide sensory innervation to the medial and anterior thigh. Another branch of the femoral nerve, the saphenous nerve, provides sensory innervation to the medial side of the leg and foot. The lateral sural cutaneous nerve is a branch of the common peroneal nerve providing sensory innervation to the skin of the lateral side of the leg. The sural nerve, which runs down the posterior leg with the lesser saphenous vein, provides sensory innervation to the posterior surface of the lower leg and the lateral side of the foot.

### Q1.26
A 20-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with features suggestive of _common peroneal nerve injury_. The common peroneal nerve is most commonly injured:
	
	A. Where it emerges below the piriformis muscle
	B. At the site where it divides into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves
	C. Where it leaves the sciatic nerve in the popliteal fossa
	D. As it branches into the head of the biceps femoris
	E. Just behind the head of the fibula

#### Answer: E. Just behind the head of the fibula - TRUE
- Peroneal neuropathies are classically associated with external compression at the level of the fibular head. The most common aetiology is habitual leg crossing (which compresses this area). Prolonged positioning with pressure at this area (eg sitting on an airplane or positioning during surgery) are other causes. Short casts or braces around this area can be factors in external compression. Other causes include operative trauma (knee surgery), fibular fracture, blunt or open trauma, and intrinsic masses (eg ganglionic cysts, schwannoma). Lack or loss of the fat pad over the fibular head as a result of sudden weight loss and/or a thin body habitus predisposes the nerve to external compression at this site.

### Q1.27
A 2-year-old baby developed chylothorax as a result of iatrogenic injury to the thoracic duct at the time of surgery to correct a congenital cardiac defect. Which of the following statements about the _thoracic duct_ is true?

	A. It returns lymph from the convex surface of the liver
	B. It extends from the fifth lumbar vertebra to the root of the neck
	C. It enters the thorax through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm
	D. It ends by opening into the angle of junction of the right subclavian vein with the right internal jugular vein 
	E. It has no valves to ensure smooth flow of lymph
	
#### Answer: D. It ends by opening into the angle of junction of the right subclavian vein with the right internal jugular vein - *FALSE* = C. It enters the thorax through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm - TRUE
- The thoracic duct conveys the greater part of the lymph and chyle into the blood. It is the common trunk of all the lymphatic vessels of the body, except those on the right side of the head, neck and thorax, and right upper extremity, the right lung, right side of the heart and convex surface of the liver. In the adult it varies in length from 38 to 45cm and extends from the second lumbar vertebra to the root of the neck. It begins in the abdomen by a triangular dilatation, the cisterna chyli, which is situated on the front of the body of the second lumbar vertebra, to the right side of and behind the aorta, and by the side of the right crus of the diaphragm. It enters the thorax through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm, and ascends through the posterior mediastinal cavity between the aorta and the azygos vein. It ends by opening into the angle of junction of the left subclavian vein with the left internal jugular vein. The thoracic duct has several valves; at its termination it is provided with a pair, the free borders of which are turned towards the vein, so as to prevent the passage of venous blood into the duct.

### Q1.28
A patient with _acute anal fissure_ has severe pain. The pain sensations in this condition are transmitted by:

	A. The superior rectal nerve
	B. The inferior rectal nerve
	C. The pelvic splanchnic nerve
	D. The perineal nerve
	E. The posterior scrotal nerve

#### Answer: C. The pelvic splanchnic nerve - *FALSE* = B. The inferior rectal nerve - TRUE
- The anal canal below the pectinate line is supplied by the inferior rectal nerve (S2, S3, S4) and is responsible for the transmission of pain sensation. Anal fissure is caused by the rupture of one of the anal valves, usually by the passage of dry hard stool in someone who is constipated. Each valve is lined by mucous membrane above and skin below. As a result of skin involvement, the condition is extremely painful and associated with marked spasm of the anal sphincters.

### Q1.29
A junior house officer is assisting repair of an inguinal hernia for the first time. The consultant asks him to identify the roof of the inguinal canal. The roof of the inguinal canal is formed by:

	A. Aponeurosis of the external oblique - F
	B. A lacunar ligament - F
	C. Reflected inguinal ligament - F
	D. Union of the transversalis fascia with the inguinal ligament - F
	E. Arched fibres of internal oblique and transversus abdominis

#### Answer: E. Arched fibres of internal oblique and transversus abdominis - TRUE
- The inguinal canal is an oblique canal about 4cm long, slanting downwards and medially, and in parallel with and a little above the inguinal ligament; it extends from the deep inguinal ring to the superficial inguinal ring. It is bounded by the integument and superficial fascia in front, by the aponeurosis of the external oblique throughout its whole length and by the internal oblique in its lateral third. It is bounded by: behind, the reflected inguinal ligament, the inguinal aponeurotic falx, the transversalis fascia, the extraperitoneal connective tissue and the peritoneum; above, the arched fibres of internal oblique and transversus abdominis; below, the union of the transversalis fascia with the inguinal ligament; and at its medial end, the lacunar ligament. The inguinal canal contains the spermatic cord and the ilioinguinal nerve in the male, and the round ligament of the uterus and the ilioinguinal nerve in the female.

### Q1.30
During mobilisation of the descending aorta for repair of coarctation of aorta, a surgeon accidentally cuts the _first aortic intercostal artery_. Which of the following structures might be deprived of its main source of blood supply?

	A. First posterior intercostal space
	B. First anterior intercostal space
	C. Right bronchus
	D. Left bronchus
	E. Fibrous pericardium
 
#### Answer: A. First posterior intercostal space - *FALSE* = C. Right bronchus - TRUE
- The right bronchus receives blood from a single right bronchial artery. This artery may branch from one of the left bronchial arteries or from the right third posterior intercostal artery, the first intercostal artery that arises from the descending aorta. Damage of this artery might stop the blood supply to the main bronchus. The intercostal arteries to the first and second intercostal spaces are derived from the highest intercostal artery, so the blood supply to either of these spaces would not be disrupted. The left bronchus is supplied by two left bronchial arteries that branch directly from the descending aorta. The fibrous pericardium is a fibrous sac containing the pericardial cavity and the heart. Its blood supply is not a major concern, and is via branches from the internal mammary and musculophrenic arteries as well as from the descending thoracic aorta.

50% - F: 31, 33, 34, 36, 40

### Q1.31
The thoracoabdominal diaphragm is pierced by three large apertures for the passage of the aorta, vena cava and oesophagus between the thorax and abdomen. Which of the following statements about these *openings in the diaphragm* is true?
	
	A. The aortic hiatus is the highest and most anterior of the large apertures
	B. The aortic hiatus is in the central tendon
	C. The oesophageal hiatus is at the level of the ninth thoracic vertebra
	D. The vena caval foramen is quadrilateral in shape
	E. The vena caval foramen transmits some branches of the left phrenic nerve
	
#### Answer: E. The vena caval foramen transmits some branches of the left phrenic nerve - *FALSE* = D. The vena caval foramen is quadrilateral in shape - TRUE
- The diaphragm is pierced by a series of apertures to permit the passage of structures between the thorax and abdomen. Three large openings include the aortic, oesophageal and vena caval openings. The aortic hiatus is the lowest and most posterior of the large apertures; it lies at the level of the twelfth thoracic vertebra. Strictly speaking, it is not an aperture in the diaphragm but an osseo-aponeurotic opening between it and the vertebral column, and it is therefore behind the diaphragm. The aorta, azygos vein and thoracic duct pass through it; occasionally the azygos vein is transmitted via the right crus. The oesophageal hiatus is situated in the muscular part of the diaphragm at the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra; it is elliptical in shape. It is placed above, in front of and a little to the left of the aortic hiatus, and transmits the oesophagus, the vagus nerves and some small oesophageal arteries. The vena caval foramen is the highest of the three, and is situated at about the level of the fibrocartilage between the eighth and ninth thoracic vertebrae. It is quadrilateral in form, and is placed at the junction of the right and middle leaflets of the central tendon, so that its margins are tendinous. It transmits the inferior vena cava (IVC), the wall of which is adherent to the margins of the opening, and some branches of the right phrenic nerve.

### Q1.32
A patient with an ulcerative carcinoma of the _posterior third of the tongue_ presented to the Emergency Department with arterial bleeding from the lesion. Which of the following arteries was involved?

	A. Deep lingual
	B. Dorsal lingual
	C. Facial - F
	D. Sublingual - F
	E. Tonsillar - F

#### Answer: B. Dorsal lingual - TRUE
- The dorsal lingual artery runs on the superficial surface of the tongue – it is a branch of the lingual artery that delivers blood to the posterior superficial tongue. This artery must, therefore, be the source of the haemorrhage. The deep lingual and sublingual arteries are two terminal branches of the lingual artery. These branches run in the floor of the mouth (sublingual) and the deep surface of the tongue (deep lingual). The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery that courses across the face. The tonsillar artery is a branch of the facial artery that supplies blood to the palatine tonsil.

### Q1.33
After a myocardial infarction a patient underwent coronary angiography, which showed a blockade in the left coronary artery. Which of the following statements about the _left coronary artery_ is true?

	A. It is smaller than the right coronary artery
	B. It gives off a large marginal branch
	C. It continues to the apex of the heart as the posterior descending branch
	D. It supplies both ventricles
	E. It supplies the whole of the conducting system of the heart
	
#### Answer: B. It gives off a large marginal branch - *FALSE* = D. It supplies both ventricles - TRUE
- The left coronary artery, larger than the right, arises from the left anterior aortic sinus and divides into an anterior descending and a circumflex branch. The anterior descending branch passes at first behind the pulmonary artery, then coming forwards between that vessel and the left auricle to reach the anterior longitudinal sulcus, along which it descends to the apex of the heart; it gives branches to both ventricles. The circumflex branch follows the left part of the coronary sulcus, running first to the left and then to the right, reaching almost as far as the posterior longitudinal sulcus; it gives branches to the left atrium and ventricle. The left coronary artery supplies only a part of the left branch of the atrioventricular (AV) bundle (of His).

### Q1.34
A 40-year-old man with dysphagia underwent oesophagoscopy, which revealed an exophytic growth in the _abdominal part of the oesophagus_. Which of the following statements about the abdominal portion of the oesophagus is true?

	A. It lies in the oesophageal groove on the posterior surface of the right lobe of the liver
	B. It is about 3.5cm in length
	C. It is supplied by the left gastric branch of the coeliac artery
	D. It is completely intraperitoneal
	E. It is mainly innervated by the left phrenic nerve

#### Answer: B. It is about 3.5cm in length - *FALSE* = C. It is supplied by the left gastric branch of the coeliac artery - TRUE
- The abdominal portion of the oesophagus lies in the oesophageal groove on the posterior surface of the left lobe of the liver. It measures about 1.25cm in length, and only its front and left aspects are covered by peritoneum. The arterial supply is mainly from the left gastric branch of the coeliac artery. The nerves are derived from the vagi and the sympathetic trunks; they form a plexus, in which there are groups of ganglion cells, between the two layers of the muscular coats, and also a second plexus in the submucous tissue.

### Q1.35
You are performing your first appendicectomy. Initially, on entering the right iliac fossa you do not find the appendix. However, you do not panic because you know that you can quickly locate it by:

	A. Palpating the ileocaecal valve and looking just above it - F
	B. Looking at the confluence of the taeniae coli
	C. Following the course of the right colic artery - F
	D. Removing the right layer of the mesentery of the jejunoileum - F
	E. Palpating and inspecting the pelvic brim - F
	
#### Answer: B. Looking at the confluence of the *taeniae coli* - TRUE
- The taeniae coli are three bands of longitudinal muscle on the surface of the large intestine. Remember that the large intestine does not have a continuous layer of longitudinal muscle; instead, it has taeniae coli. The base of the appendix is fairly constant and is located at the posteromedial wall of the caecum about 2.5cm below the ileocaecal valve. This is also where the taeniae converge. The base is at a constant location, whereas the position of the tip of the appendix varies. In 65% of patients, the tip is located in a retrocaecal position, in 30% it is located at the brim or in the true pelvis and in 5% it is extraperitoneal, situated behind the caecum, ascending colon or distal ileum. The location of the tip of the appendix determines early signs and symptoms in acute appendicitis. The appendix is below the ileocaecal valve, not above it. It is not near the right colic artery, which supplies the ascending colon. The appendix would not be found by removing a layer of the mesentery of the jejunoileum; in fact, the appendix has its own mesentery – the mesoappendix. Finally, the appendix is not on the pelvic brim.

### Q1.36
A 26-year-old woman developed Bell’s palsy of the facial nerve. Which of the following statements about the **facial nerve** is true?

	A. It supplies the muscles of mastication - F: facial expression
	B. It contains some sympathetic motor fibres, which constitute the vasodilator nerves of the parotid gland
	C. It is a pure motor nerve
	D. It has a sensory part that contains the fibres of taste for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue
	E. It arises from the midbrain

#### Answer: B. It contains some sympathetic motor fibres, which constitute the vasodilator nerves of the parotid gland - *FALSE* = D. It has a sensory part that contains the fibres of taste for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue - TRUE
- The facial nerve consists of a motor and sensory part, the latter being frequently described under the name nervus intermedius. The two parts emerge at the lower border of the pons in the recess between the olive and the inferior peduncle. The motor part supplies somatic motor fibres to the muscles of the face, scalp and auricle, buccinator and platysma, stapedius, stylohyoid and the posterior belly of the digastric; it also contains some sympathetic motor fibres that constitute the vasodilator nerves of the submaxillary and sublingual glands; these are conveyed through the chorda tympani nerve. They are preganglionic fibres of the parasympathetic system and terminate in the submaxillary ganglion and small ganglia in the hilus of the submaxillary gland. From these ganglia postganglionic fibres are conveyed to these glands. The sensory part contains the fibres of taste for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and a few somatic sensory fibres from the middle-ear region. A few splanchnic sensory fibres are also present.

### Q1.37
You are assisting exploratory laparotomy for a firearm injury involving the second part of the duodenum. On entering the peritoneal cavity, which of the following structures will you see _anterior to the second part of the duodenum_?

	A. Right colic flexure
	B. Hilum of right kidney
	C. Renal vessels - F
	D. Inferior vena cava - F
	E. Psoas muscle - F

#### Answer: A. Right colic flexure - TRUE
- The descending portion (second part) of the duodenum is in relation, in front from above downwards, with the duodenal impression on the right lobe of the liver, the transverse colon and the small intestine; behind, it has a variable relation with the front of the right kidney in the neighbourhood of the hilum, and is connected to it by loose areolar tissue. The renal vessels, the IVC and the psoas muscle below are also behind it. At its medial side is the head of the pancreas and the common bile duct; to its lateral side is the right colic flexure.

### Q1.38
The cystic artery supplying the gallbladder is usually a branch of:

	A. The gastroduodenal artery - F
	B. The right gastric artery - F
	C. The hepatic proper artery - F
	D. The right hepatic artery
	E. The left hepatic artery

#### Answer: D. The right hepatic artery - TRUE
- The cystic artery, usually a branch of the right hepatic, passes downwards and forwards along the neck of the gallbladder, and divides into two branches, one of which ramifies on the free surface and the other on the attached surface of the gallbladder.
- The cystic artery normally passes through the Calot’s (hepatobiliary) triangle. This anatomic feature is important during cholecystectomy. The hepatobiliary triangle is an anatomic space bordered by the common hepatic duct medially, the cystic duct inferiorly and the inferior border of the liver superiorly.

### Q1.39
The femoral triangle is bounded laterally by the medial border of:
	A. Sartorius
	B. Iliacus
	C. Psoas major - F
	D. Pectineus - F
	E. Adductor brevis - F

#### Answer: A. Sartorius - TRUE
- The femoral triangle is a depression seen immediately below the fold of the groin. Its apex is directed downwards; the sides are formed laterally by the medial margin of the sartorius, medially by the medial margin of adductor longus and above by the inguinal ligament. The floor of the space is formed from its lateral-to-medial side by iliacus, psoas major, pectineus, in some cases a small part of adductor brevis and adductor longus. It is divided into two almost equal parts by the femoral vessels, which extend from near the middle of its base to its apex: in this situation the artery gives off its superficial and profunda branches, the vein receiving the deep femoral and great saphenous tributaries. On the lateral side of the femoral artery is the femoral nerve, dividing into its branches. In addition to the vessels and nerves, this space contains some fat and lymphatics.

### Q1.40
After a street fight a young man arrived in the Emergency Department with a _stab wound on the right thigh involving the adductor canal_. Which of the following structures is most likely to be injured in this patient?

	A. The popliteal artery
	B. The saphenous vein
	C. The sural nerve
	D. The obturator artery
	E. The nerve to vastus medialis

#### Answer: A. The popliteal artery - *FALSE* = E. The nerve to vastus medialis - TRUE
- The adductor canal is an aponeurotic tunnel in the middle third of the thigh, extending from the apex of the femoral triangle to the opening in the adductor magnus. It is bounded, in front and laterally, by vastus medialis and, behind, by adductor longus and adductor magnus. It is covered in by a strong aponeurosis that extends from vastus medialis, across the femoral vessels to adductor longus and adductor magnus. Sartorius lies on the aponeurosis. The canal contains the femoral artery and vein, the saphenous nerve and the nerve to vastus medialis.

Questions 1.41-1.50
-------------------

40% - F: 41, 43, 45, 46, 49, 50

### Q1.41
During surgery on the right submandibular gland the _lingual nerve gets injured_. Postoperatively, the patient will complain of:

	A. Deviation of the tongue to the right
	B. Deviation of the tongue to the left
	C. Loss of taste sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the right side of the tongue
	D. Loss of taste sensation over the posterior one-third of the right side of the tongue
	E. Loss of general sensation over the posterior one-third of the right side of the tongue
	
#### Answer: A. Deviation of the tongue to the right - *FALSE* = C. Loss of taste sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the right side of the tongue - TRUE
- The lingual nerve is one of the two terminal branches of the posterior division of the mandibular nerve. It is sensory to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and floor of the mouth. However, the fibres of the chorda tympani (branch of facial nerve), which is secretomotor to the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands and gustatory to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, are also distributed through the lingual nerve. Lingual nerve injury, causing numbness, dysaesthesia, paraesthesia, and dysgeusia that involves the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, may complicate invasive dental and surgical procedures.

### Q1.42
The _superior gluteal artery_ typically exits the pelvis:

	A. Above the lumbosacral trunk
	B. Between the lumbosacral trunk and S1 nerve
	C. Between the S1 and S2 nerves
	D. Between the S2 and S3 nerves
	E. Through the lesser sciatic foramen

#### Answer: B. Between the lumbosacral trunk and S1 nerve - TRUE
- The superior gluteal artery, the largest branch of the internal iliac artery, appears to be a continuation of the posterior division of that vessel. It is a short artery that runs backwards between the lumbosacral trunk and the first sacral nerve; passing out of the pelvis above the upper border of the piriformis, it immediately divides into superficial and deep branches. Within the pelvis it gives off a few branches to iliacus, piriformis and obturator internus and, just before leaving that cavity, a nutrient artery that enters the ilium.

### Q1.43
An injury involving the _anatomical snuffbox_ is likely to damage:

	A. The radial nerve
	B. The median nerve
	C. The radial artery
	D. The ulnar nerve
	E. The ulnar artery
	
#### Answer: A. The radial nerve - *FALSE* = C. The radial artery - TRUE
- The anatomical snuffbox is a triangular depression on the lateral side of the wrist. It is seen best when the thumb is extended. It is bounded anteriorly by the tendons of abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis, and posteriorly by the tendon of extensor pollicis longus. It is limited above by the styloid process of the radius. The floor of the snuffbox is formed by the scaphoid and trapezium, and it is crossed by the radial artery.

### Q1.44
A patient presents to the Emergency Department with a bullet wound that has _severed the musculocutaneous nerve at its origin_. On clinical examination which of the following will be elicited?

	A. Action of supinator
	B. Action of brachialis - F
	C. Action of coracobrachialis - F
	D. Action of biceps brachii - F
	E. Sensations over lower two-thirds of the dorsolateral surface of the forearm - F

#### Answer: A. Action of supinator - TRUE
- The musculocutaneous nerve arises from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus, opposite the lower border of pectoralis minor, its fibres being derived from the fifth, sixth and seventh cervical nerves. In its course through the arm, it supplies coracobrachialis, biceps brachii and the greater part of brachialis. Through the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm it supplies the skin of the lateral side of the forearm from the elbow to the wrist. Supinator is supplied by the posterior interosseus nerve.

### Q1.45
During cranial nerve examination, the integrity of the _right trochlear nerve_ can be tested by asking the patient to look:

	A. Towards the nose in a horizontal plane
	B. Inwards, towards the nose and downwards
	C. Laterally in a horizontal plane
	D. Outwards, away from the nose and downwards
	E. Inwards, towards the nose and upwards

#### Answer: D. Outwards, away from the nose and downwards - *FALSE* = B. Inwards, towards the nose and downwards - TRUE
- The trochlear nerve (cranial nerve or CN IV) innervates the superior oblique muscle, so, to test this muscle, the eye needs to turn inwards (towards the nose) and downwards. The abducens nerve (CN VI) innervates the lateral rectus muscle. The oculomotor nerve (CN III) innervates the superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus and inferior oblique muscles.
- To understand this question, you need to understand how the motions of the eye are tested. As the actions of the extraocular muscles are complex, it is necessary to turn the eye to a position where a single action of each muscle predominates when evaluating the individual muscles. To test the superior and inferior recti, a patient needs to turn the eye outwards approximately 25°. At this position, the superior rectus will simply act to raise the eye and the inferior rectus to lower the eye. To test the superior and inferior obliques, a patient needs to turn the eye inwards about 50°. When the eye is in this position, the superior oblique muscle will act to lower the eye and the inferior oblique to raise the eye.

### Q1.46
Clinical examination of a patient complaining of frequent episodes of aspiration of fluid into her lungs after subtotal thyroidectomy revealed that the _area of the piriform recess above the vocal fold of the larynx was numb_. This is the result of intraoperative injury to:

	A. The lingual nerve - F
	B. The recurrent laryngeal nerve - F
	C. The external branch of the superior pharyngeal nerve
	D. The hypoglossal nerve - F
	E. The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve

#### Answer: C. The external branch of the superior pharyngeal nerve - *FALSE* = E. The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve - TRUE
- The internal branch of the superior laryngeal is a sensory nerve that pierces the thyrohyoid membrane along with the superior laryngeal artery. It supplies sensory fibres to the mucous membrane of the larynx, superior to the vocal folds. As this area has lost sensation, it appears that the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve must have been injured. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is a motor nerve that innervates the cricothyroid muscle – it does not provide any sensory innervation to the larynx. The recurrent laryngeal nerve ascends from the thorax and provides motor innervation to the upper oesophagus, lower pharynx and all the laryngeal muscles except the cricothyroid muscle. The hypoglossal nerve supplies motor innervation to the muscles of the tongue. The lingual nerve is a sensory nerve for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. These nerves are not important for innervating the larynx.

### Q1.47
A patient with _enlarged deep cervical lymph nodes_ as a result of a metastatic carcinoma complains of hoarseness. The hoarse voice is caused by enlarged nodes pressing:

	A. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve
	B. The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve
	C. The recurrent laryngeal branch of vagus
	D. The nerve to the cricothyroid muscle
	E. The pharyngeal branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve

#### Answer: C. The recurrent laryngeal branch of vagus - TRUE
- Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve is one possible cause of hoarseness. The recurrent laryngeal nerve changes its name to the inferior laryngeal nerve at the level of the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage. The inferior laryngeal nerve goes on to innervate all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx except cricothyroid. So, if this nerve innervating all the muscles of the larynx were damaged, a patient would have a hoarse voice. The external and internal branches of the superior laryngeal nerve innervate cricothyroid, the inferior pharyngeal constrictor, and provide secretomotor fibres to mucosal glands of the larynx above the vocal folds. The pharyngeal branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve provides sensory innervation to the pharynx.

### Q1.48
A patient presents to the Emergency Department with a laceration on the temporal region, resulting in _loss of sensation from the temporal region and loss of secretory function of the parotid gland_. The laceration has severed:

	A. The chorda tympani
	B. The posterior deep temporal nerve
	C. The facial nerve
	D. The auriculotemporal nerve
	E. The great auricular nerve

#### Answer: D. The auriculotemporal nerve - TRUE
- The auriculotemporal nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3). It has two important functions: first, it carries postganglionic parasympathetic fibres to the parotid gland. These fibres come from the otic ganglia, where they are synapsed with the presynaptic fibres from the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). Second, the auriculotemporal nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the anterosuperior ear, part of the external auditory meatus and the temporomandibular joint. So, the listed symptoms match with an injury to the auriculotemporal nerve.
- Chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve that provides secretomotor innervation to the submandibular and sublingual glands. It carries preganglionic parasympathetic axons to the submandibular ganglion. In the infratemporal fossa, chorda tympani joins the lingual nerve; it continues with the lingual nerve to the tongue where it supplies taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The posterior deep temporal nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies motor innervation to temporalis. The facial nerve (CN VII) innervates all the muscles of facial expression, and, through chorda tympani, provides secretomotor innervation to the submandibular and sublingual glands as well as taste sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Finally, the great auricular nerve comes from the cervical plexus; it provides sensory innervation to the skin of the ear and the skin below the ear.

### Q1.49
A 16-year-old boy with _left-sided indirect inguinal hernia_ presents to the Emergency Department with features of large bowel obstruction resulting from the hernia. The intestinal segment most likely to be involved in this obstruction is:

	A. The caecum
	B. The ascending colon
	C. The descending colon
	D. The rectum
	E. The sigmoid colon

#### Answer: C. The descending colon - *FALSE* = E. The sigmoid colon - TRUE
- The sigmoid colon is the most likely intestinal segment to be involved in a left-sided indirect inguinal hernia, mainly because of its location but also because it has a mesentery. Although the descending colon is on the left side of the abdomen as well, it is slightly superior to be herniating through the deep inguinal ring. The ascending colon and caecum are on the right side of the abdomen, so they would not be involved in a left-sided hernia. Finally, the rectum is a structure in the pelvis; it is too inferior to enter the deep inguinal ring and cause an indirect inguinal hernia. Moreover, all of these structures lack a mesentery and hence are not mobile enough to herniate.

### Q1.50
While walking barefooted in the garden a housewife was injured with a broken piece of glass that penetrated the plantar aponeurosis and injured _muscles in the first layer_. Which of the following muscles is most likely to be affected?

	A. Abductor digiti minimi
	B. Flexor accessorius 
	C. Lumbricales
	D. Adductor hallucis
	E. Interossei
	
#### Answer: C. Lumbricales - *FALSE* = A. Abductor digiti minimi - TRUE
- The muscles in the plantar region of the foot may be divided into three groups, in a similar manner to those in the hand. Those of the medial plantar region are connected with the great toe, and correspond with those of the thumb; those of the lateral plantar region are connected with the little toe, and correspond with those of the little finger; and those of the intermediate plantar region are connected with the tendons intervening between the two former groups. To facilitate the description of these muscles, however, it is more convenient to divide them into four layers, in the order in which they are successively exposed. The first layer contains abductor hallucis, flexor digitorum brevis and abductor digiti minimi. The second layer contains flexor accessorius and lumbricales. The third layer has three muscles, namely flexor hallucis brevis, adductor hallucis and flexor digiti minimi brevis. The fourth layer includes four dorsal and three plantar interossei.


Questions 1.51-1.60
-------------------

??% = F: 52, 53, 54, 55, 58, 59, 60

### Q1.51
The posterior mediastinal structure most closely applied to the _posterior surface of the pericardial sac_ is:

	A. The aorta
	B. The oesophagus
	C. The azygos vein
	D. The thoracic duct
	E. The trachea

#### Answer: B. The oesophagus - TRUE
- The oesophagus is closely related to the posterior surface of the pericardial sac. After coming from the heart, the aorta arches over the left pulmonary artery and left bronchus. Eventually, just above the diaphragm, this vessel is posterior to the oesophagus. The azygos vein, on the right side of the thorax, arches over the right pulmonary artery and bronchus. It is also posterior to the oesophagus. The thoracic duct is posterior to the oesophagus as well and does not contact the pericardial sac. Finally, the trachea is superior to the heart.

### Q1.52
The muscle of the forearm _innervated by both median and ulnar nerves_ is:

	A. Flexor carpi ulnaris
	B. Flexor digitorum superficialis
	C. Flexor digitorum profundus
	D. Pronator quadratus
	E. Flexor pollicis longus

#### Answer: A. Flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) - *FALSE* = C. Flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) - TRUE
- The median and ulnar nerve both innervate flexor digitorum profundus. Flexor carpi ulnaris is innervated by the ulnar nerve only. Flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor pollicis longus are innervated by the median nerve. Pronator quadratus is innervated by the anterior interosseus nerve, which is a branch of the median nerve.

### Q1.53
The hand muscle likely to be affected by compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel is:

	A. Flexor pollicis brevis (FPB)
	B. Opponens digiti minimi
	C. Flexor pollicis longus (FPL)
	D. Dorsal interossei
	E. Palmar interossei
	
#### Answer: C. Flexor pollicis longus (FPL) - *FALSE* = A. Flexor pollicis brevis (FPB) - TRUE
- The recurrent branch of the median nerve innervates the thenar compartment of the hand, including flexor pollicis brevis, abductor pollicis brevis and opponens pollicis. Therefore, if the median nerve were compressed, all of these muscles could be affected. The dorsal interossei, palmar interossei and opponens digiti minimi are all muscles of the hand that are innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. Flexor pollicis longus is innervated by the median nerve, but it is a forearm muscle that is proximal to the carpal tunnel, so it would not be affected by compressing the median nerve in the carpal tunnel.

### Q1.54
The carpal bone most commonly _dislocated by a fall on an outstretched hand_ (FOOSH) is:

	A. The trapezoid
	B. The lunate
	C. The scaphoid
	D. The hamate
	E. The capitate
	
#### Answer: D. The hamate - *FALSE* = B. The lunate - TRUE
- It is fairly common for the lunate to be dislocated anteriorly; this injury may result from a fall on a dorsiflexed wrist. The lunate may be pushed out of its place on the floor of the carpal tunnel and move towards the palm of the wrist. This dislocation may compress the median nerve and lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. The lateral bone in the proximal row of carpals, which is also scaphoid, is frequently fractured when someone falls on an outstretched wrist. Capitate, hamate and trapezoid are not commonly injured in these falls.

### Q1.55
A 45-year-old woman with carcinoma of the breast has enlarged axillary lymph nodes. About 75% of the _lymph draining the breast_ goes to:

	A. The deltopectoral lymph nodes
	B. The lateral axillary lymph nodes
	C. The parasternal lymph nodes
	D. The subscapular lymph nodes
	E. The central axillary lymph nodes
	
#### Answer: C. The parasternal lymph nodes - *FALSE* = E. The central axillary lymph nodes - TRUE
- About 75% of the lymph draining the breast goes to the axillary lymph nodes, via the pectoral lymph nodes. All of this lymph from the pectoral lymph nodes must drain to the central lymph nodes as well. This is why it is so important to examine all these groups of axillary lymph nodes when performing a breast examination. Most of the rest of the lymph drainage from the breast goes to the parasternal nodes, although a small amount goes to the opposite breast and a further small amount drains to the abdominal wall.

### Q1.56
After a right-sided mastectomy a woman complains of winging of the scapula. The most likely nerve to be injured in this operation is:

	A. The long thoracic nerve
	B. The accessory nerve
	C. The lateral pectoral nerve
	D. The phrenic nerve
	E. The vagus nerve

#### Answer: A. The long thoracic nerve (_of Bell_) - TRUE
- An injury to the long thoracic nerve denervates serratus anterior, meaning that there will be no muscle protracting the scapula and counteracting trapezius and the rhomboids, powerful retractors of the scapula. This means that the scapula will be winged backwards, which is this patient’s main symptom. The long thoracic nerve is derived from the nerve roots of C5–C7. This nerve is particularly vulnerable to iatrogenic injury during surgical procedures, such as mastectomies, because it is located on the superficial side of serratus anterior.
- The accessory nerve innervates trapezius, so an injury to this nerve might lead to an inability to raise the acromion of the shoulder. The lateral pectoral nerve is a small nerve that provides innervation to pectoralis major. The phrenic nerve innervates the diaphragm. The vagus nerve provides parasympathetic innervation to the thorax and much of the abdominal viscera. The patient’s symptoms do not fit with an injury to any of these nerves.

### Q1.57
A patient with aortic dissection suffered infarction of the lower spinal cord as a result of extension of the dissection into the **Artery of Adamkiewicz**. Which of the following statements best describes this artery?

	A. It is also known as the artery of lumbar enlargement
	B. It is a radicular artery in the lower thoracic or upper lumbar region
	C. It is most frequently found on the right side - F
	D. It has extensive anastomoses on the surface of the sacral spinal cord - F
	E. It passes through foramina in the bodies of the vertebrae to reach the cord - F
	
#### Answer: B. It is a radicular artery in the lower thoracic or upper lumbar region - TRUE
- The artery of Adamkiewicz is also known as the great radicular artery. It is frequently found on the left side in the lower thoracic or upper lumbar region. Similar to all other radicular arteries, it must run with rootlets to reach the spinal cord. The great radicular artery anastomoses on the surface of the thoracic spinal cord and serves as a major blood supply for the lower spinal cord. In fact, disruption of this artery may lead to paraplegia as a result of infarction of the lumbar and sacral portions of the spinal cord. It has a variable origin from level T9 to L3 but has been found to originate as low as L5. Abdominal aortic aneurysm thrombosis can occlude the origin of this artery as can aortic dissection, resulting in acute spinal ischaemia. In all cases of abdominal aorta surgery, preoperative investigations to determine the (variable) origin of the artery of Adamkiewicz are necessary. Identification of its site of origin reduces the incidence of spinal cord injury and surgery time during the repair of thoracoabdominal or descending aorta aneurysms.

### Q1.58
A superficial cut on the _ulnar side of forearm_ is most likely to damage:
	
	A. The basilic vein
	B. The cephalic vein
	C. The median cubital vein
	D. The median antebrachial vein
	E. The ulnar vein
	
#### Answer: C. The median cubital vein - *FALSE* = A. The basilic vein - TRUE
- The basilic vein is on the ulnar side of the forearm, near the fifth finger. It arises from the medial side of the dorsal venous arch of the hand and drains blood from the medial (ulnar) side of the arm. The cephalic vein takes its origin from the lateral side of the dorsal venous arch of the hand and then runs up the lateral (radial) forearm. The median antebrachial vein runs down the centre of the anterior forearm, draining into the median cubital vein. The median cubital vein connects the cephalic vein to the basilic vein in the cubital fossa. Finally, the ulnar vein is a deep vein that runs with the ulnar artery.

### Q1.59
A patient with fracture of the _surgical neck of humerus_ is most likely to injure:

	A. The subscapular artery
	B. The circumflex scapular artery
	C. The posterior humeral circumflex artery
	D. The radial recurrent artery
	E. The brachial artery
	
#### Answer: B. The circumflex scapular artery - *FALSE* = C. The posterior humeral circumflex artery - TRUE
- The posterior and anterior circumflex arteries wrap around the humerus near its surgical neck. A fracture to the surgical neck could damage either of these arteries or the axillary nerve. The subscapular artery is a branch of the third part of the axillary artery – it branches to form the thoracodorsal artery and the circumflex scapular artery. The radial recurrent artery is a branch of the radial collateral artery; it contributes to collateral circulation around the elbow. The brachial artery is an artery situated deep in the arm; it is close to the humerus, so fracture of the shaft of humerus at midarm might result in damage to this vessel.

### Q1.60
A fracture of the _sustentaculum tali_ will adversely affect the function of:

	A. Flexor digitorum longus
	B. Flexor hallucis longus
	C. Fibularis longus
	D. Tibialis anterior
	E. Tibialis posterior
	
#### Answer: E. Tibialis posterior - *FALSE* (Guess) = Answer: B Flexor hallucis longus - TRUE
- Sustentaculum tali is a shelf-like, medial projection of the calcaneus that supports the talus. The tendon of flexor hallucis longus passes under sustentaculum tali, creating a groove in the bone. So, if sustentaculum tali were fractured, the tendon of flexor hallucis longus would be displaced from its usual position and the muscle would be affected. The peroneus longus tendon enters the foot on the lateral side. It grooves the cuboid bone and travels deep to the long plantar ligament to insert on the medial cuneiform bone. The tendon of flexor digitorum longus crosses on to the plantar surface anterior to sustentaculum tali and eventually divides into four tendons that insert into the bases of the distal phalanges of the second to fifth digits. The tendon from tibialis anterior crosses the dorsal side of the foot and inserts on the medial surface of the first cuneiform and first metatarsal. Finally, the tibialis posterior tendon crosses under the foot on the medial side, anterior to both flexor hallucis longus and flexor digitorum longus. It inserts on navicular, medial cuneiform and second to fourth metatarsals.


Questions 1.61-1.70
-------------------

60% - F: 61, 63, 64, 69

### Q1.61
A 16-year-old girl stepped on a broken piece of glass while walking barefoot and severed the lateral plantar nerve in her left foot. The _lateral plantar nerve_ is a branch of:
	
	A. The tibial nerve
	B. The sural nerve
	C. The deep peroneal nerve
	D. The saphenous nerve
	E. The femoral nerve

#### Answer: B. The sural nerve - *FALSE* = A. The tibial nerve - TRUE
- The lateral and medial plantar nerves are both branches of the tibial nerve. These branches continue to the plantar surface of the foot, innervating the muscles there and providing cutaneous innervation to the skin of the sole. The sural nerve is a cutaneous nerve that provides sensory innervation to the skin of the posterior surface of the lower leg and the skin of the lateral side of the foot. The deep peroneal nerve innervates the anterior compartment of the leg and the muscles on the dorsum of the foot, and provides sensory innervation to the web of skin between the first and second toes. The saphenous nerve is a branch of the femoral nerve that travels with the great saphenous vein; it provides cutaneous innervation to the skin of the medial sides of both the leg and the foot. The femoral nerve innervates the anterior (quadriceps) compartment of the thigh, which allows for extension at the knee.

### Q1.62
**Scissor gait** is caused by _adduction of the thigh_. The nerve responsible for this abnormality is:

	A. The femoral nerve - F
	B. The tibial nerve - F
	C. The saphenous nerve - F
	D. The inferior gluteal nerve
	E. The obturator nerve
	
#### Answer: E. The obturator nerve - TRUE
- ‘Scissor gait’ is a condition in which one limb crosses in front of the other during stepping as a result of powerful hip adduction caused by continuous, unwanted, nerve activity. The obturator nerve innervates the medial (adductor) compartment of the thigh, including adductor longus, magnus and brevis. If the obturator nerve were firing too much, the leg would be constantly adducting, causing the scissor gait. The femoral nerve innervates the quadriceps muscles, which extend the leg at the knee. The tibial nerve innervates the hamstrings, which flex the knee and extend the thigh. The tibial nerve also innervates the muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg, which plantarflex the foot. The saphenous nerve is a branch of the femoral nerve that travels with the great saphenous vein; it provides cutaneous innervation to the skin of the medial side of both the leg and the foot. The inferior gluteal nerve innervates gluteus maximus, which is important for powerful extension of the thigh.

### Q1.63
_Avascular necrosis of the femoral head_ after fracture of the neck of the femur results from interruption of:

	A. The lateral circumflex femoral artery
	B. The internal pudendal artery
	C. The first perforating branch of the deep femoral artery
	D. The medial circumflex femoral artery
	E. The descending genicular artery

#### Answer: A. The lateral circumflex femoral artery - *FALSE* = D. The medial circumflex femoral artery - TRUE
- The medial circumflex femoral artery supplies blood to the femoral neck. During fractures of the femoral neck, this artery may be ruptured and the femoral neck deprived of blood. The internal pudendal artery is the major source of blood to the perineum. The perforating branches of the deep femoral artery supply the posterior compartment of the thigh, including the hamstrings. The lateral circumflex femoral artery supplies the lateral thigh and hip. Although it contributes to the circulation around the hip, the primary supply to the head of the femur usually comes from the medial femoral circumflex. The descending genicular artery branches from the femoral artery, just superior to the adductor hiatus, and supplies blood to the knee joint.

### Q1.64
A patient with a bleeding gastric ulcer of the _lesser curvature of the stomach_ is scoped to identify the source of bleeding. The vessel most likely to be involved will be:

	A. The left gastric artery
	B. The left gastroepiploic artery
	C. The right gastroepiploic artery
	D. The gastroduodenal artery
	E. The short gastric arteries
	
#### Answer: C. The right gastroepiploic artery - *FALSE* = A. The left gastric artery - TRUE
- The left gastric artery is the artery that supplies the lesser curvature of the stomach (along with the right gastric artery.) These two arteries would be the most likely to cause bleeding at the lesser curvature of the stomach. The left gastric is one of the three arteries that come off the coeliac trunk. The left and right gastroepiploic arteries are the two arteries that supply the greater curvature of the stomach. The gastroduodenal artery is a branch off the common hepatic artery, which supplies the duodenum, head of pancreas and greater curvature of the stomach. The short gastric arteries are four or five small arteries from the splenic artery that supply the fundus of the stomach.

### Q1.65
At the time of _splenectomy_, the _tail of pancreas_ must be identified in:

	A. The transverse mesocolon - F
	B. The gastrocolic ligament - F
	C. The gastrosplenic ligament
	D. The phrenicolic ligament - F
	E. The splenorenal ligament

#### Answer: E. The splenorenal ligament - TRUE
- The splenorenal ligament is the peritoneal structure that connects the spleen to the posterior abdominal wall over the left kidney. It also contains the tail of the pancreas. The transverse mesocolon connects the transverse colon to the posterior abdominal wall. The gastrocolic ligament connects the greater curvature of the stomach with the transverse colon. The gastrosplenic ligament connects the greater curvature of the stomach with the hilum of the spleen. Finally, the phrenicolic ligament connects the splenic flexure of the colon to the diaphragm.

### Q1.66
Of the organs listed below the one that is _covered entirely by visceral peritoneum_ is:

	A. The pancreas - F
	B. The spleen
	C. The adrenal gland - F
	D. The kidney
	E. The duodenum - F
	
#### Answer: B. The spleen - TRUE
- The spleen is the only organ listed that is covered entirely by visceral peritoneum. The kidney and suprarenal glands are retroperitoneal organs. This is different to the secondarily retroperitoneal organs, which started out in a mesentery and were then pushed against the posterior wall. The kidneys and suprarenal glands began developing in the retroperitoneum and stayed there. The duodenum and pancreas are partially peritonealised and partially retroperitoneal. The first 2cm of the superior duodenum is peritonealised, but the rest of the duodenum, up to the duodenojejunal junction, is retroperitoneal. For the most part, the pancreas is secondarily retroperitoneal, although the tail of the pancreas is peritonealised, lying within the splenorenal ligament.

### Q1.67
You have scrubbed up for the first time with your consultant who is performing exploratory laparotomy for a mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. You are asked by your consultant to identify the third part of the duodenum. Which of the following features will enable you to correctly identify this?

	A. It is 10cm long
	B. It begins at the left side of the upper border of the fourth lumbar vertebra
	C. It is crossed by the superior mesenteric vessels
	D. It is 2cm medial to the mesentery of the small bowel
	E. Its upper surface is in relation with the tail of the pancreas

#### Answer: C. It is crossed by the superior mesenteric vessels - TRUE
- The third, preaortic, transverse or horizontal portion of the duodenum is from 5 to 7.5cm long. It begins at the right side of the upper border of the fourth lumbar vertebra and passes from right to left, with a slight inclination upwards, in front of the great vessels and crura of the diaphragm; it ends in the ascending portion in front of the abdominal aorta. The superior mesenteric vessels and mesentery cross it and its front surface is covered by peritoneum, except near the middle line where it is crossed by the superior mesenteric vessels. Its posterior surface is not covered by peritoneum, except towards its left extremity, where the posterior layer of the mesentery may sometimes be found covering it to a variable extent. This surface rests on the right crus of the diaphragm, the IVC and the aorta. The upper surface is in relation with the head of the pancreas.

### Q1.68
Compared with the _ileum_, the _jejunum_:

	A. Is narrow
	B. Is thinner
	C. Is less vascular
	D. Has larger villi
	E. Has more numerous Peyer’s patches

#### Answer: D. Has larger villi - TRUE
- Compared with the ileum the jejunum is wider, its diameter being about 4cm, and it is thicker, more vascular and of a deeper colour than the ileum, so that a given length weighs more. The circular folds (valvulae conniventes) of the jejunum’s mucous membrane are large and thickly set, and its villi are larger than in the ileum. The aggregated lymph nodules are almost entirely absent in the upper part of the jejunum; in the lower part, they are found less frequently than in the ileum, are smaller and tend to assume a circular form. By grasping the jejunum between the finger and thumb, the circular folds can be felt through the walls of the gut, these being absent in the lower part of the ileum. It is possible in this way to distinguish the upper from the lower part of the small intestine.

### Q1.69
While performing exploratory laparotomy, which of the following features will help you to _distinguish the ileum from the jejunum_?

	A. It possesses numerous circular folds
	B. It chiefly occupies the umbilical and left iliac regions - F
	C. It has larger and more numerous aggregated lymph nodes - F
	D. It is more vascular
	E. It is retroperitoneal - F

#### Answer: A. It possesses numerous circular folds - *FALSE* = C. It has larger and more numerous aggregated lymph nodes - TRUE
- The ileum is narrow, its diameter being 3.75cm, and its coat thinner and less vascular than that of the jejunum. It possesses just a few circular folds, which are small and disappear entirely towards its lower end, although aggregated lymph nodules (Peyer’s patches) are larger and more numerous. For the most part the jejunum occupies the umbilical and left iliac regions, whereas the ileum occupies chiefly the umbilical, hypogastric, right iliac and pelvic regions. The terminal part of the ileum usually lies in the pelvis, from which it ascends over the right psoas and right iliac vessels; it ends in the right iliac fossa by opening into the medial side of the start of the large intestine. The jejunum and ileum are attached to the posterior abdominal wall by an extensive fold of peritoneum, the mesentery, which allows the freest motion, so that each coil can accommodate itself to changes in form and position.

### Q1.70
A 62-year-old with chronic alcohol problems developed obstructive jaundice as a result of a carcinoma in the head of the pancreas. Which of the following statements about the _head of the pancreas_ is true?

	A. It is lodged within the curve of the jejunum - F
	B. It is posteriorly related to the superior mesenteric vessels
	C. It is posteriorly related to the root of the mesentery - F
	D. It is posteriorly related to the common bile duct 
	E. It is anteriorly related to the right crus of diaphragm - F
	
#### Answer: D. It is posteriorly related to the common bile duct - TRUE
- The head of the pancreas is flattened backwards and lodged within the curve of the duodenum. Its upper border is overlapped by the superior part of the duodenum and its lower border overlaps the horizontal part; its right and left borders overlap in front and insinuate themselves behind the descending and ascending parts of the duodenum, respectively. The greater part of the right half of its anterior surface is in contact with the transverse colon, with only areolar tissue intervening. From its upper part, the neck springs, its right limit being marked by a groove for the gastroduodenal artery. The lower part of the right half, below the transverse colon, is covered by peritoneum continuous with the inferior layer of the transverse mesocolon; this is in contact with the coils of the small intestine. The superior mesenteric artery passes down in front of the left half across the uncinate process; the superior mesenteric vein runs upwards on the right side of the artery and, behind the neck, joins with the splenic vein to form the portal vein. The posterior surface is in relation with the IVC, common bile duct, renal veins, right crus of the diaphragm and aorta.


Questions 1.71-1.80
-------------------

20% - F: 71, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79 

### Q1.71
Embryologically, as the pancreas develops in two parts it has two ducts. Which of the following statements about the _main pancreatic duct_ is true?

	A. It is also called the duct of Wirsung
	B. It extends transversely from right to left through the substance of the pancreas
	C. It has the common bile duct on its left side as it leaves the head of pancreas
	D. It ends by an orifice common to it and the common bile duct in the third part of the duodenum
	E. It is a derivative of the dorsal pancreatic bud

#### Answer: B. It extends transversely from right to left through the substance of the pancreas - *FALSE* = 
- The main pancreatic duct, also called the duct of Wirsung, extends transversely from left to right through the substance of the pancreas. It starts by the junction of the small ducts of the lobules, situated in the tail of the pancreas; running from left to right through the body, it receives the ducts of the various lobules that make up the gland. Considerably augmented in size, it reaches the neck and, turning downwards, backwards and to the right, it comes into relation with the common bile duct, which lies to its right side. Leaving the head of the gland, it passes very obliquely through the mucous and muscular coats of the duodenum, ending by an orifice common to it and the common bile duct on the summit of the duodenal papilla, situated at the medial side of the descending (second) portion of the duodenum, 7.5–10cm below the pylorus. Sometimes, the pancreatic duct and the common bile duct open separately into the duodenum. Frequently, there is an additional duct, which is given off from the pancreatic duct in the neck of the pancreas and opens into the duodenum about 2.5cm above the duodenal papilla. It receives the ducts from the lower part of the head, and is known as the accessory pancreatic duct (duct of Santorini).
- The pancreas is developed in two parts: dorsal and ventral. The former arises as a diverticulum from the dorsal aspect of the duodenum a short distance above the hepatic diverticulum; growing upwards and backwards into the dorsal mesogastrium, it forms part of the head and uncinate process and the whole of the body and tail of the pancreas. The ventral part appears in the form of a diverticulum from the primitive bile duct and forms the remainder of the head and uncinate process of the pancreas. The duct of the dorsal part (accessory pancreatic duct) therefore opens independently into the duodenum, whereas that of the ventral part (pancreatic duct) opens with the common bile duct.

### Q1.72
The anterior surface of the right kidney is related to:

	A. The medial lumbocostal arch - F
	B. The iliohypogastric nerve - F
	C. The ilioinguinal nerve - F
	D. The last thoracic nerve - F
	E. The right colic flexure

#### Answer: E. The right colic flexure - TRUE
- A narrow portion of the anterior surface of the right kidney at the upper extremity is in relation with the right suprarenal gland. A large area just below this, involving about three-quarters of the surface, lies in the renal impression on the inferior surface of the liver, and a narrow but somewhat variable area near the medial border is in contact with the descending part of the duodenum. The lower part of the anterior surface is in contact laterally with the right colic flexure, and medially, as a rule, with the small intestine. The areas in relation with the liver and small intestine are covered by peritoneum; the suprarenal, duodenal and colic areas are devoid of peritoneum. The posterior relations of the right kidney are: the last thoracic, iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves, the diaphragm, medial and lateral lumbocostal arches, psoas major, quadratus lumborum and the tendon of transversus abdominis, the subcostal and one or two of the upper lumbar arteries, as well as the twelfth rib.

### Q1.73
During exploratory laparotomy, which of the following features will enable you to identify the _superior surface of the liver_?

	A. It is made up of the right lobe only
	B. It is covered by peritoneum only along the line of attachment of the falciform ligament
	C. It is related to the seventh and eighth costal cartilages on the left side
	D. It is related to the fifth to eighth ribs on the right side
	E. It is in contact with the pylorus in the angle between the diverging rib cartilage of opposite sides
	
#### Answer: D. It is related to the fifth to eighth ribs on the right side - *FALSE* = C. It is related to the seventh and eighth costal cartilages on the left side - TRUE
- The superior surface of the liver comprises part of both lobes; as a whole, it is convex and fits under the vault of the diaphragm, which in front separates it on the right from the sixth to the tenth ribs and their cartilages, and on the left from the seventh and eighth costal cartilages. Its middle part lies behind the xiphoid process and, in the angle between the diverging rib cartilage of opposite sides, it is in contact with the abdominal wall. Behind this the diaphragm separates the liver from the lower part of the lungs and pleurae, the heart and pericardium, and the right costal arches from the seventh to the eleventh ribs inclusive. It is completely covered by peritoneum, except along the line of attachment of the falciform ligament.

### Q1.74
A 45-year-old man with Barrett’s oesophagus underwent oesophagoscopy to grade the intestinal metaplasia. Which of the following statements about the oesophagus is true?

	A. It is about 35cm long
	B. It mainly occupies the middle mediastinum
	C. It enters the abdomen opposite the twelfth thoracic vertebra
	D. It receives its arterial supply from the thyrocervical trunk
	E. It is supplied by the phrenic nerve

#### Answer: A. It is about 35cm long - *FALSE* = D. It receives its arterial supply from the thyrocervical trunk - TRUE
- The oesophagus is a muscular canal, about 23–25cm (10 inches) long, extending from the pharynx to the stomach. It begins in the neck at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, opposite the sixth cervical vertebra, descends along the front of the vertebral column, through the superior and posterior mediastina, passes through the diaphragm and, entering the abdomen, ends at the cardiac orifice of the stomach, opposite the eleventh thoracic vertebra. The arteries supplying the oesophagus are derived from the inferior thyroid branch of the thyrocervical trunk, the descending thoracic aorta, the left gastric branch of the coeliac artery and the left inferior phrenic branch of the abdominal aorta. They have for the most part a longitudinal direction. The nerves are derived from the vagi and the sympathetic trunks; they form a plexus, in which there are groups of ganglion cells, between the two layers of the muscular coats, and also a second plexus in the submucous tissue.

### Q1.75
A stab wound into the ischiorectal fossa 2cm lateral to the anal canal is likely to damage:

	A. The perineal body
	B. The pudendal nerve
	C. The vesicular bulb
	D. The inferior rectal artery
	E. The crus of the penis

#### Answer: A. The perineal body - *FALSE* = B. The pudendal nerve - TRUE
- The pudendal nerve is found about 2cm lateral to the anal canal, so it is the structure most likely to be damaged by the stab wound. The crus of the penis is the lateral part of the corpus cavernosum found at the base of the penis. It is anterior, not lateral, to the anal canal. The perineal body is a structure found in the female only; it is a fibromuscular mass found in the plane between the anal canal and the perineal membrane, which serves at the convergence of several muscles. It is anterior to the anal canal. The inferior rectal artery is a branch of the internal pudendal artery, which delivers blood to the inferior part of the rectum. It would not be injured by the stabbing because it is located on the surface of the rectum, not 2cm lateral to the anal canal. Finally, the vesicular bulb is a structure of erectile tissue located on either side of the vestibule of the vagina, attached to the perineal membrane, so it would be anterior to the site of the stabbing.

### Q1.76
A 78-year-old man with acute urinary retention was noticed to have benign prostatic hyperplasia on digital examination per rectum. Which of the following statements about the _prostate gland_ is true?

	A. It is situated immediately above the internal urethral orifice
	B. It is held in place by the ischioprostatic ligaments
	C. It is invested by the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm
	D. It is a purely glandular body
	E. It is perforated by the ejaculatory ducts
	
#### Answer: A. It is situated immediately above the internal urethral orifice - *FALSE* = E. It is perforated by the ejaculatory ducts - TRUE
- The prostate is a firm, partly glandular and partly muscular body, which is placed immediately below the internal urethral orifice and around the start of the urethra. It is situated in the pelvic cavity, below the lower part of the symphysis pubis, above the superior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm and in front of the rectum, through which it may be distinctly felt, especially when enlarged. It is about the size of a chestnut and somewhat conical in shape; for examination it presents a base, an apex, and an anterior, a posterior and two lateral surfaces. It is held in its position by the puboprostatic ligaments, the superior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm, which invests the prostate and the start of the membranous portion of the urethra, and the anterior portions of the levator ani muscles, which pass backwards from the pubis and embrace the sides of the prostate. From the support that they afford to the prostate, these portions of the levator ani are named the levator prostatae. The prostate is perforated by the urethra and the ejaculatory ducts. The urethra usually lies along the junction of its anterior with its middle third. The ejaculatory ducts pass obliquely downwards and forwards through the posterior part of the prostate, and open into the prostatic portion of the urethra.

### Q1.77
A 17-year-old girl presented to the Emergency Department with typical ureteric colic. Which of the following statements about the _ureter_ is true?

	A. It measures about 15cm in length
	B. On the right side at its origin it is covered by the ascending part of the duodenum
	C. On the left side it is crossed by the left colic vessels
	D. It receives direct arterial supply from the descending aorta
	E. It is supplied by the genitofemoral nerve

#### Answer: D. It receives direct arterial supply from the descending aorta - *FALSE* = C. On the left side it is crossed by the left colic vessels - TRUE
- The ureter measures from 25 to 30cm in length; it is a thick-walled, narrow, cylindrical tube that is directly continuous near the lower end of the kidney with the tapering extremity of the renal pelvis. It runs downwards and medially in front of the psoas major; entering the pelvic cavity, it finally opens into the fundus of the bladder. At its origin the right ureter is usually covered by the descending part of the duodenum, and in its course downwards lies to the right of the IVC; it is crossed by the right colic and ileocolic vessels, whereas near the superior aperture of the pelvis it passes behind the lower part of the mesentery and the terminal part of the ileum. The left ureter is crossed by the left colic vessels; near the superior aperture of the pelvis it passes behind the sigmoid colon and its mesentery. The arteries supplying the ureter are branches from the renal, internal spermatic, hypogastric and inferior vesical. The nerves are derived from the inferior mesenteric, spermatic and pelvic plexus.

### Q1.78
A 20-year-old Asian man is seen in the orthopaedics outpatient clinic by a junior house officer with complaints of a large tender mass over the back and a similar mass in the ipsilateral groin. The junior house officer diagnoses tuberculosis of the lumbar spine with a cold abscess that has tracked along a muscle to the groin. 

Which of the following muscles is most likely to be involved?

	A. Gluteus maximus
	B. Gluteus minimus
	C. Adductor longus
	D. Psoas major
	E. Piriformis
	
#### Answer: E. Piriformis - *FALSE* = D. Psoas major - TRUE
- This is the classic presentation of psoas abscess secondary to tuberculosis (TB) of the spine. TB of the spine forms 50–60% of the total incidence of skeletal TB. It is a disease of childhood and adolescence, 50% of cases occurring before the age of 20. The most common level of the lesion is the thoracolumbar. This is because movement and the stress of weight-bearing are maximum at this level. The proximity of the cysterna chyli may cause lymphatic spread of the infection from foci in the mesenteric lymph glands. The disease affects the spine secondarily from a primary focus in the lungs or mediastinal glands through the bloodstream. The formation of a cold abscess is an invariable feature of TB of the spine. The abscess forms in the paravertebral areas and soon tracks downwards, as a result of gravity, and towards the surface, following the tracks of nerves and blood vessels. As long as the abscess remains deep to the deep fascia, it remains cold to touch with no inflammatory reaction; hence, its name – cold abscess. There is no correlation between the size of the destructive lesion and the quantity of pus in the cold abscess. The size is determined by the degree of allergic exudative reaction that produces the pus. Thoracolumbar cold abscess can either point in the back or enter the psoas sheath and track down as psoas and iliac abscesses. These abscesses collect as lumps in the iliac fossa and point above the inguinal ligament, or track down behind the inguinal ligament and point in the femoral triangle or even lower down. A search for the cold abscess including a careful palpation of the abdomen is an essential part of the clinical examination.

### Q1.79
Which of the following statements best describes the _transpyloric plane_?

	A. It lies midway between the nipples and the pubic symphysis
	B. It lies roughly a hand’s breadth below the xiphisternal joint
	C. It passes anteriorly through the tip of the tenth costal cartilage
	D. It passes posteriorly through the body of the second lumbar vertebra near its lower border
	E. It cuts through the body of the stomach

#### Answer: E. It cuts through the body of the stomach - *FALSE* = B. It lies roughly a hand’s breadth below the xiphisternal joint - TRUE
- The transpyloric plane lies halfway between the jugular notch and the upper border of the pubic symphysis. It also lies roughly a hand’s breadth below the xiphisternal joint. Anteriorly, it passes through the tip of the ninth costal cartilage. Posteriorly, it passes through the body of the first lumbar vertebra near its lower border. It cuts through the pylorus.

### Q1.80
A 25-year-old man arrived in the Emergency Department with a firearm injury to the right popliteal fossa that had severed his popliteal artery. Which of the following statements about the _popliteal artery_ is true?

	A. It is the continuation of the profunda femoral artery - F
	B. It divides at the lower border of adductor magnus into its terminal branches
	C. In the middle part of its course, it is crossed from the lateral to the medial side by the tibial nerve and the popliteal vein
	D. It is related laterally to semimembranosus
	E. It is related medially to biceps femoris

#### Answer: C. In the middle part of its course, it is crossed from the lateral to the medial side by the tibial nerve and the popliteal vein - TRUE
- The popliteal artery is the continuation of the femoral artery, and courses through the popliteal fossa. It extends from the opening in the adductor magnus, at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the thigh, downwards and laterally to the intercondyloid fossa of the femur, and then vertically downwards to the lower border of the popliteus, where it divides into anterior and posterior tibial arteries. The anterior relations of the artery from above downwards are the popliteal surface of the femur (which is separated from the vessel by some fat), the back of the knee joint and the fascia covering the popliteus. Posteriorly, it is overlapped by semimembranosus above, and covered by gastrocnemius and plantaris below. In the middle part of its course the artery is separated from the skin and fasciae by a quantity of fat, and is crossed from the lateral to the medial side by the tibial nerve and popliteal vein, the vein being between the nerve and the artery and closely adherent to the latter. On its lateral side, above, are biceps femoris, the tibial nerve, the popliteal vein and the lateral condyle of the femur; below are plantaris and the lateral head of gastrocnemius. On its medial side, above, are semimembranosus and the medial condyle of the femur; below are the tibial nerve, the popliteal vein and the medial head of gastrocnemius.


Questions 1.81-1.90
-------------------

40% = F: 81, 82, 83, 85, 88, 89

### Q1.81
An _acoustic neuroma_ (tumour of eighth cranial nerve - CN IIX) is also likely to involve:

	A. The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)
	B. The abducent nerve (CN VI)
	C. The trigeminal nerve (CN V)
	D. The facial nerve (CN VII)
	E. The vagus nerve (CN X)

#### Answer: C. The trigeminal nerve (CN V) - *FALSE* = D. The facial nerve (CN VII) - TRUE
- The facial nerve enters the temporal bone with the vestibulocochlear nerve – both cross into the internal acoustic meatus. The glossopharyngeal (CN IX), vagus (CN X) and spinal accessory (CN XI) nerves all leave through the jugular foramen. The abducent (CN VI) crosses through the superior orbital fissure, along with the oculomotor (CN III), trochlear (CN IV) and ophthalmic division of trigeminal (CN V1) nerves. The three divisions of the trigeminal nerve all leave through different foramina: the ophthalmic division exits through the superior orbital fissure; the maxillary division leaves through the foramen rotundum; and the mandibular division leaves through the foramen ovale.

### Q1.82
A bullet entering the _right side of the neck at the c4 vertebral_ level is most likely to injure which of the following structures?

	A. The spinal root of accessory nerve
	B. The superior cervical ganglion
	C. The stellate ganglion
	D. The cricoid cartilage
	E. The bifurcation of common carotid artery

#### Answer: A. The spinal root of accessory nerve - *FALSE* = E. The bifurcation of common carotid artery - TRUE
- The spinal root of the accessory nerve crosses the transverse process of atlas at the C1 level. The superior cervical ganglion is situated at the C2 level. The stellate ganglion is located at the C7 level. The cricoid cartilage corresponds to the C6 level. The C4 vertebral level corresponds to bifurcation of the common carotid arteries as well as the upper border of the thyroid cartilage.

### Q1.83
The movements that take place at the knee joint are flexion and extension and, in certain positions of the joint, internal and external rotation. Which of the following statements about the _knee joint_ is true?

	A. It consists of three articulations in one
	B. It has an anterior cruciate ligament that is stronger and shorter than the posterior cruciate ligament
	C. It has a circular medial meniscus
	D. It has a medial meniscus that covers a larger portion of the articular surface than the lateral one
	E. It has a ligamentum patella that is the central portion of the common tendon of quadratus femoris

#### Answer: E. It has a ligamentum patella that is the central portion of the common tendon of quadratus femoris - *FALSE* = A. It consists of three articulations in one - TRUE
- Technically, the knee joint is regarded as consisting of three articulations in one: two condyloid joints, one between each condyle of the femur and the corresponding meniscus and condyle of the tibia; and a third between the patella and the femur, partly arthrodial, but not completely so, because the articular surfaces are not mutually adapted to each other, so that the movement is not a simple gliding one. The cruciate ligaments are of considerable strength, situated in the middle of the joint, nearer to its posterior than to its anterior surface. They are called cruciate because they cross each other somewhat like the lines of the letter X, and have received the names anterior and posterior, from the position of their attachments to the tibia. The posterior cruciate ligament is stronger, but shorter and less oblique in its direction, than the anterior. The menisci are two crescent-shaped lamellae, which serve to deepen the surfaces of the head of the tibia for articulation with the condyles of the femur. The medial meniscus is almost semicircular in form whereas the lateral meniscus is almost circular and covers a larger portion of the articular surface than the medial one. The ligamentum patellae is the central portion of the common tendon of quadriceps femoris, which is continued from the patella to the tuberosity of the tibia.

### Q1.84
A person is seen in the Emergency Department with a _shallow knife wound in the posterior triangle_ of the neck about 1.5 inches (4cm) above the clavicle. He is complaining of anaesthesia below the wound and over the acromion and clavicle. The nerve most probably injured was:

	A. The greater auricular nerve
	B. The supraclavicular nerve
	C. The lesser occipital nerve
	D. The suprascapular nerve
	E. The transverse cervical nerve

#### Answer: B. The supraclavicular nerve - TRUE
- The supraclavicular nerves arise from the third and fourth cervical (C3, C4) nerves; they emerge beneath the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid, and descend in the posterior triangle of the neck beneath platysma and deep cervical fascia. Near the clavicle they perforate the fascia and platysma to become cutaneous, and are arranged, according to their position, into three groups: anterior, middle and posterior. These cutaneous nerves provide sensory innervation to the skin of the root of the neck, upper chest and upper shoulder. These nerves innervate the skin right above the clavicle. The great auricular nerve comes from C2 and C3 branches in the cervical plexus; it provides sensory innervation to the ear and the skin below the ear. The lesser occipital nerve comes from C2 in the cervical plexus – it innervates the skin behind the ear. The transverse cervical nerve is also a cutaneous branch from the cervical plexus – it is from C2 and C3 and provides sensory innervation to the skin of the neck anteriorly. The suprascapular nerve is not a cutaneous nerve – it comes from the superior trunk of the brachial plexus and provides motor innervation to supraspinatus and infraspinatus.

### Q1.85
Thrombotic occlusion of the _coeliac trunk_, with preservation of function of the organs supplied by this artery, is possibly caused by anastomosis between:
	
	A. The left gastric artery and right gastric artery
	B. The left gastroepiploic artery and right gastroepiploic artery
	C. The proper hepatic artery and gastroduodenal artery
	D. The right colic artery and middle colic artery
	E. The superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery
	
#### Answer: C. The proper hepatic artery and gastroduodenal artery - *FALSE* = E. The superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery - TRUE
- The superior pancreaticoduodenal artery is a branch of the gastroduodenal artery, which in turn is a branch of the common hepatic artery, itself a branch of the coeliac trunk. The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is a branch of the superior mesenteric artery. Occlusion of the coeliac trunk would allow blood from the superior mesenteric artery to reach the branches of the coeliac trunk, via the connections between the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries. Both the left and right gastric arteries receive their blood from the coeliac trunk. The left gastric artery is a direct branch of the coeliac trunk. The right gastric artery is usually a branch of the proper hepatic artery, which in turn is a branch of the common hepatic artery (a branch of the coeliac trunk). Both the left and right gastroepiploic arteries receive their blood supply from the coeliac trunk. The left gastroepiploic artery is a branch of the splenic artery, which in turn is a branch of the coeliac trunk. The right gastroepiploic artery is a branch of the gastroduodenal artery, which in turn is a branch of the common hepatic artery (a branch of the coeliac trunk). The proper hepatic and gastroduodenal arteries are branches of the common hepatic artery, which in turn is a branch of the coeliac trunk. The right colic and middle colic arteries are both branches of the superior mesenteric artery.

### Q1.86
Infection from an abscess on the upper eyelid can spread to the _dural venous sinuses_ of the brain as a result of _direct communication between the superior ophthalmic vein_ and:
	A. The superior petrosal sinus
	B. The occipital sinus - F
	C. The cavernous sinus
	D. The sigmoid sinus
	E. The straight sinus - F

#### Answer: C. The cavernous sinus - TRUE
- The anterior continuation of the cavernous sinus, the superior ophthalmic vein, passes through the superior orbital fissure to enter the orbit. Veins of the face communicate with the superior ophthalmic vein. As a result of the absence of valves in emissary veins, venous flow may occur in either direction. Cutaneous infections may be carried into the cavernous sinus and result in a cavernous sinus infection, which may lead to an infected cavernous sinus thrombosis. The cavernous sinus is lateral to the pituitary gland and contains portions of cranial nerves III, IV, V1, V2 and VI, and the internal carotid artery. The occipital sinus is at the base of the falx cerebelli in the posterior cranial fossa. It drains into the confluence of sinuses. The sigmoid sinus is the anterior continuation of the transverse sinus in the middle cranial fossa. The sigmoid sinus passes through the jugular foramen and drains into the internal jugular vein. The straight sinus is at the intersection of the falx cerebri and the falx cerebelli in the posterior cranial fossa. The straight sinus connects the inferior sagittal sinus with the confluence of sinuses. The superior petrosal sinus is at the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and is a posterior continuation of the cavernous sinus. The superior petrosal sinus connects the cavernous sinus with the sigmoid sinus.

### Q1.87
A large benign tumour arising from the _choroidal plexus of the lateral ventricle_ and extending into a surrounding structure is most likely to involve:

	A. The pons
	B. The caudate nucleus
	C. The cerebellum
	D. The hippocampus
	E. The hypothalamus

#### Answer: B. The caudate nucleus - TRUE
- Tumours of the ventricular system of the brain can affect the brain tissue either directly, via pressure on or invasion into a physically close structure, or indirectly, by obstructing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and causing hydrocephalus. The caudate nucleus is a C-shaped structure that comprises part of the wall of the lateral ventricle throughout its extent. The only structure listed that is adjacent to the body of the lateral ventricle, and would therefore be directly affected by the large tumour arising from the choroidal plexus of the lateral ventricle, is the caudate nucleus. The cerebellum overlies the fourth ventricle. The hippocampus is adjacent to the inferior (temporal) horn of the lateral ventricle; the hypothalamus abuts the third ventricle; the pons forms part of the floor of the fourth ventricle.

### Q1.88
During clinical examination, a _piece of paper is put between adjacent surfaces of the patient’s index and middle fingers_ and he is asked to squeeze them together with sufficient force to hold the paper. This test assesses the function of:

	A. The first dorsal and first palmar interosseous muscles
	B. The first dorsal and second palmar interosseous muscles
	C. The first lumbrical and second dorsal interosseous muscles
	D. The second dorsal and first palmar interosseous muscles
	E. The second dorsal and second palmar interosseous muscles

#### Answer: B. The first dorsal and second palmar interosseous muscles - *FALSE* = D. The second dorsal and first palmar interosseous muscles - TRUE
- This manoeuvre is meant to test adduction of the index finger and abduction of the middle finger. When testing for abduction and adduction of digits in the hand, it is important to remember that the midline extends through the middle digit. So, this patient is trying to adduct his index finger by pulling it towards the midline and abduct his middle finger by pulling it away from the midline. This means that the patient is using the first palmar interosseous muscle (the adductor) on his index finger and the second dorsal interosseous muscle (the abductor) on his middle finger.

### Q1.89
During cholecystectomy accidental injury to a vessel in the area _immediately posterior to the epiploic foramen_ resulted in _torrential haemorrhage_. The vessel most likely to be involved is:

	A. The inferior vena cava
	B. The aorta
	C. The portal vein
	D. The right renal artery
	E. The superior mesenteric vein
	
#### Answer: C. The portal vein - *FALSE* = A. The inferior vena cava - TRUE
- The epiploic foramen, also called the omental foramen, is the passageway between the greater and lesser peritoneal sacs. The IVC lies immediately posterior to this foramen, so this is the vessel that was probably injured. The aorta lies next to the IVC, but it is a little more to the left and a little deeper; it does not therefore lie immediately posterior to the epiploic foramen. The hepatic portal vein is anterior to the epiploic foramen. The right renal artery is a branch of the aorta. Similar to the aorta, it is too deep to be a vessel immediately behind the foramen. Finally the superior mesenteric vein is anterior to the foramen. As this is one of the two vessels that makes the hepatic portal vein, if the hepatic portal vein is anterior to the foramen, the superior mesenteric vein should also be anterior.

### Q1.90
During cholecystectomy the _cystic artery_ is usually found in the **‘Triangle of Calot’** formed by:
	
	A. The cystic duct, right hepatic artery and right hepatic duct - F
	B. The gallbladder, liver and common bile duct - F
	C. The left hepatic duct, liver and cystic duct - F
	D. The right branch of the portal vein, liver and common bile duct - F
	E. The common hepatic duct, liver and cystic duct

#### Answer: E. The common hepatic duct, liver and cystic duct - TRUE
- The ‘Triangle of Calot’ is formed by the cystic duct laterally, the liver superiorly and the common hepatic duct medially. It is an important landmark in this region, because the cystic artery can be found in the triangle of Calot. During cholecystectomy, the cystic artery needs to be ligated. Although the cystic artery usually branches from the right hepatic artery, there is some variation. However, identification of the triangle of Calot can aid in finding the cystic artery, in that triangle, from where it can be traced back to its origin and ligated there.


Questions 1.91-1.100
--------------------

70% = F: 93, 95, 99

### Q1.91
The cremasteric muscle is an extension of:

	A. The external abdominal oblique muscle
	B. The internal oblique muscle
	C. The rectus abdominis muscle
	D. The pyramidalis muscle
	E. The dartos muscle
	
#### Answer: B. The internal oblique muscle - TRUE
- The cremaster is a thin muscular layer, composed of a number of fasciculi that arise from the middle of the inguinal ligament, where its fibres are continuous with those of the internal oblique and also occasionally with transversus abdominis. It passes along the lateral side of the spermatic cord, descends with it through the superficial inguinal ring on the front and sides of the cord, and forms a series of loops that differ in thickness and length in different individuals. At the upper part of the cord the loops are short, but they become longer and longer in succession, the longest reaching down as low as the testis, where a few are inserted into tunica vaginalis. These loops are united by areolar tissue, and form a thin covering over the cord and testis, the cremasteric fascia. The fibres ascend along the medial side of the cord, and are inserted by a small pointed tendon into the tubercle and crest of the pubis and the front of the sheath of rectus abdominis.

### Q1.92
Which of the following structures corresponds to the T8 vertebral level?

	A. The manubriosternal junction - F
	B. The inferior angle of scapula - F
	C. The medial end of spine of scapula - F
	D. The vena caval opening in diaphragm - TRUE
	E. The suprasternal notch - F

#### Answer: D. The vena caval opening in diaphragm - TRUE
- The vena caval opening in the diaphragm is situated at about the level of the fibrocartilage between the eighth and ninth thoracic vertebrae. It is quadrilateral in form and placed at the junction of the right and middle leaflets of the central tendon, so that its margins are tendinous. It transmits the IVC, the wall of which is adherent to the margins of the opening, and some branches of the right phrenic nerve. The manubriosternal junction (angle of louis) is at the level of T4–5 vertebrae. The inferior angle of the scapula is at the T7 level. The medial end of the spine of the scapula is at the T3 level whereas the suprasternal notch corresponds to the T2–3 vertebral level.

### Q1.93
While mobilising structures in the pelvis to perform abdominoperineal resection, the surgeon accidentally injures a branch of the posterior division of the internal iliac artery. Which of the following is most likely to be injured?

	A. Superior vesical artery
	B. Superior gluteal artery
	C. Obturator artery
	D. Internal pudendal artery
	E. Middle rectal artery

#### Answer: E. Middle rectal artery - *FALSE* = B. Superior gluteal artery - TRUE
- The internal iliac artery supplies the walls and viscera of the pelvis, the buttock, the generative organs and the medial side of the thigh. It is a short, thick vessel, smaller than the external iliac, and about 4cm in length. It arises at the bifurcation of the common iliac, opposite the lumbosacral articulation, and, passing downwards to the upper margin of the greater sciatic foramen, divides into two large trunks – anterior and posterior. The anterior division gives rise to the superior, middle and inferior vesical arteries, middle rectal artery, obturator artery, internal pudendal artery, inferior gluteal artery, and uterine and vaginal arteries (in females). The posterior division gives rise to the iliolumbar artery, lateral sacral artery and superior gluteal artery.

### Q1.94
The _posterior triangle of the neck_ is bounded by:

	A. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, inferior border of the mandible and anterior midline of the neck - F
	B. The anterior borders of both sternocleidomastoid muscles, inferior border of the mandible and suprasternal notch of the manubrium - F
	C. The posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and clavicle and anterior border of the trapezius muscle
	D. The anterior borders of both trapezius muscles and occipital bone and posterior midline of the neck - F
	E. Both bellies of the digastric muscle and the inferior border of the mandible - F

#### Answer: C. The posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and clavicle and anterior border of the trapezius muscle - TRUE
- The posterior triangle is bounded, in front by the sternocleidomastoid and behind by the anterior margin of trapezius; its base is formed by the middle third of the clavicle and its apex by the occipital bone. The space is crossed, about 2.5cm above the clavicle, by the inferior belly of omohyoid, which divides it into two triangles: upper or occipital and lower or subclavian.

### Q1.95
The _phrenic nerve_ supplies the thoracoabdominal diaphragm. Which of the following statements about the phrenic nerve is true?

	A. It has a root value of C2, C3
	B. It is a pure motor nerve
	C. It runs obliquely across the front of the sternocleidomastoid muscle
	D. It descends almost vertically behind the root of the lung 
	E. It is accompanied by the pericardiacophrenic branch of the internal mammary artery in the thorax

#### Answer: D. It descends almost vertically behind the root of the lung - *FALSE* = E. It is accompanied by the pericardiacophrenic branch of the internal mammary artery in the thorax - TRUE
- The phrenic nerve contains motor and sensory fibres in the proportion of about two to one. It arises chiefly from the fourth cervical nerve, but receives a branch from the third and another from the fifth (the fibres from the fifth occasionally come through the nerve to the subclavius). It descends to the root of the neck, running obliquely across the front of scalenus anterior, and beneath sternocleidomastoid, the inferior belly of the omohyoid, and the transverse cervical and transverse scapular vessels. It next passes in front of the first part of the subclavian artery, between it and the subclavian vein, and, as it enters the thorax, it crosses the internal mammary artery near its origin. Within the thorax, it descends almost vertically in front of the root of the lung and then between the pericardium and the mediastinal pleura, to the diaphragm, where it divides into branches that pierce that muscle and are distributed to its under-surface. In the thorax, it is accompanied by the pericardiacophrenic branch of the internal mammary artery.

### Q1.96
Iatrogenic injury to the _thoracodorsal nerve_ at the time of excision of a lump in the scapular region will affect:

	A. Latissimus dorsi
	B. Serratus anterior
	C. Serratus posterior inferior
	D. Levator scapulae
	E. Longissimus

#### Answer: A. Latissimus dorsi - TRUE
- The thoracodorsal nerve, a branch of the posterior cord of the plexus, derives its fibres from the fifth, sixth and seventh cervical nerves; it follows the course of the subscapular artery, along the posterior wall of the axilla to latissimus dorsi, in which it may be traced as far as the lower border of the muscle. Injury to the thoracodorsal nerve will affect latissimus dorsi.

### Q1.97
While removing a lump from the sole of the foot the surgeon accidentally injures the _medial plantar nerve_. Which of the following muscles will be paralysed as a result of this iatrogenic injury?

	A. Plantar interossei
	B. Second lumbrical
	C. Flexor digitorum brevis
	D. Dorsal interossei
	E. Abductor digiti minimi

#### Answer: C. Flexor digitorum brevis - TRUE
- Flexor digitorum brevis, flexor hallucis brevis, abductor hallucis and the first lumbrical are supplied by the medial plantar nerve; all the other muscles in the sole of the foot are supplied by the lateral plantar. The first dorsal interosseous frequently receives an extra filament from the medial branch of the deep peroneal nerve on the dorsum of the foot and the second dorsal interosseous a twig from the lateral branch of the same nerve.

### Q1.98
The portal vein conveys blood from the abdominal part of the digestive tract (with the exception of the lower part of the rectum) and from the spleen, pancreas and gallbladder to the liver. Which of the following statements about the _portal vein_ is true?

	A. It is about 20cm in length
	B. It is formed at the level of the first lumbar vertebra - F
	C. It is formed by the junction of the inferior mesenteric and splenic veins - F
	D. It is placed behind and between the common bile duct and the hepatic artery in the lesser omentum
	E. It is surrounded by the portal plexus of nerves - F

#### Answer: D. It is placed behind and between the common bile duct and the hepatic artery in the lesser omentum - TRUE
- The portal vein is about 8cm in length and formed at the level of the second lumbar vertebra by the junction of the superior mesenteric and lienal veins; the union of these veins takes place in front of the IVC and behind the neck of the pancreas. It passes upwards behind the superior part of the duodenum and then ascends in the right border of the lesser omentum to the right extremity of the porta hepatis, where it divides into a right and a left branch, which accompany the corresponding branches of the hepatic artery into the substance of the liver. In the lesser omentum it is placed behind and between the common bile duct and the hepatic artery, the former lying to the right of the latter. It is surrounded by the hepatic plexus of nerves and accompanied by numerous lymphatic vessels and some lymph glands.

### Q1.99
Which of the following structures will have intact function after a displaced fracture of the medial epicondyle of humerus?

	A. Ulnar nerve
	B. Pronator teres
	C. Flexor carpi radialis
	D. Palmaris longus
	E. Flexor digitorum profundus (FDP)

#### Answer: E. Flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) - TRUE
- The medial epicondyle, larger and more prominent than the lateral, is directed a little backwards; it gives attachment to the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow joint, the pronator teres and a common tendon of origin of some of the flexor muscles of the forearm (including palmaris longus, flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris); the ulnar nerve runs in a groove on the back of this epicondyle. Flexor digitorum profundus is situated on the ulnar side of the forearm, immediately beneath the superficial flexors. It arises from the upper three-quarters of the volar and medial surfaces of the body of the ulna, embracing the insertion of brachialis above and extending below to within a short distance of pronator quadratus. It also arises from a depression on the medial side of the coronoid process, by an aponeurosis from the upper three-quarters of the dorsal border of the ulna, in common with flexor and extensor carpi ulnaris, and from the ulnar half of the interosseous membrane.

### Q1.100
A road traffic victim in the Emergency Department was noticed to have clinical features suggestive of paralysis of the _right suprascapular nerve_. Which of the following statements about the suprascapular nerve is true?

	A. It contains nerve fibres from C5 and C6 spinal cord 
	B. It innervates the teres minor muscle
	C. It provides cutaneous innervation to the posterolateral surface of the shoulder
	D. It is a branch of the middle trunk of the brachial plexus - F
	E. It courses superior to the suprascapular ligament

#### Answer - B. It innervates the teres minor muscle - *FALSE* = A. It contains nerve fibres from C5 and C6 spinal cord - TRUE
- The suprascapular nerve arises from the trunk formed by union of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. It runs laterally beneath trapezius and omohyoid, and enters the supraspinatous fossa through the suprascapular notch, below the superior transverse scapular ligament; it then passes beneath the supraspinatus, and curves around the lateral border of the spine of the scapula to the infraspinatous fossa. In the supraspinatous fossa it gives off two branches to the supraspinatous muscle and an articular filament to the shoulder joint; in the infraspinatous fossa it gives off two branches to the infraspinatous muscle, in addition to some filaments to the shoulder joint and scapula.


Questions 1.101-1.110
---------------------

50% = F: 101, 102, 105, 108, 110

### Q1.101
While exposing the internal carotid artery in the carotid triangle for carotid endarterectomy, the surgeon must avoid a vital structure that lies _anteromedial_ to the _internal carotid artery_. This vital structure is:

	A. The internal jugular vein
    B. The vagus nerve
    C. The external carotid artery
	D. The glossopharyngeal nerve
	E. The hypoglossal nerve
	    
#### Answer: A. The internal jugular vein - *FALSE* = C. The external carotid artery - TRUE
- The internal carotid artery supplies the anterior part of the brain, the eye and its appendages, and sends branches to the forehead and nose. Its size, in the adult, is equal to that of the external carotid, although, in the child, it is larger than this vessel. It is remarkable for the number of curvatures that it presents in different parts of its course. In considering the course and relations of this vessel it is usually divided into four portions: cervical, petrous, cavernous and cerebral. In the neck the internal carotid begins at the bifurcation of the common carotid, opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and runs perpendicularly upwards, in front of the transverse processes of the upper three cervical vertebrae, to the carotid canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It is comparatively superficial at its start, where it is contained in the carotid triangle, and lies behind and lateral to the external carotid, overlapped by the sternocleidomastoid, and covered by the deep fascia, platysma and integument. It then passes beneath the parotid gland, being crossed by the hypoglossal nerve, the digastric and stylohyoid muscles, and the occipital and posterior auricular arteries. Higher up, it is separated from the external carotid by styloglossus and stylopharyngeus, the tip of the styloid process and the stylohyoid ligament, the glossopharyngeal nerve and the pharyngeal branch of the vagus. It is in relation, behind, with longus capitis, the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk and the superior laryngeal nerve; laterally, it is in relation with the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve, the nerve lying on a plane posterior to the artery, and medially with the pharynx, superior laryngeal nerve and ascending pharyngeal artery. At the base of the skull the glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory and hypoglossal nerves lie between the artery and the internal jugular vein.

### Q1.102
The _pterygoid venous plexus_ drains the _infratemporal fossa_ via:
	
	A. The external jugular vein
	B. The internal jugular vein
	C. The posterior auricular vein
	D. The maxillary vein
	E. The superficial temporal vein

#### Answer: A. The external jugular vein - *FALSE* = D. The maxillary vein - TRUE
- The pterygoid plexus is of considerable size and situated between temporalis and the external pterygoid and partly between the external and internal pterygoids. It receives tributaries corresponding with the branches of the internal maxillary artery. Thus, it receives the sphenopalatine, middle meningeal, deep temporal, pterygoid, masseteric, buccinator, alveolar and some palatine veins, and a branch that communicates with the ophthalmic vein through the inferior orbital fissure. The pterygoid venous plexus drains the infratemporal fossa via the maxillary vein. This plexus communicates freely with the anterior facial vein; it also communicates with the cavernous sinus, via branches through the foramen of Vesalius, foramen ovale and foramen lacerum.

### Q1.103
The masseter is an important muscle of mastication. Which of the following statements about the _masseter_ is true?

	A. It extends almost horizontally between the infratemporal fossa and the condyle of the mandible
	B. It consists of superficial and deep portions
	C. It arises by two heads
	D. It assists in opening the mouth - F
	E. It is supplied by the seventh cranial nerve - F

#### Answer: B. It consists of superficial and deep portions - TRUE
- The masseter is a thick, somewhat quadrilateral muscle, consisting of two portions: superficial and deep. The larger superficial portion arises by a thick, tendinous aponeurosis from the zygomatic process of the maxilla, and from the anterior two-thirds of the lower border of the zygomatic arch; its fibres pass downwards and backwards, to be inserted into the angle and lower half of the lateral surface of the ramus of the mandible. The deep portion is much smaller and more muscular in texture; it arises from the posterior third of the lower border and from the whole of the medial surface of the zygomatic arch; its fibres pass downwards and forwards, to be inserted into the upper half of the ramus and the lateral surface of the coronoid process of the mandible. The deep portion of the muscle is partly concealed, in front, by the superficial portion; behind, it is covered by the parotid gland. The fibres of the two portions are continuous at their insertion. The masseter, along with temporalis and the internal pterygoid, raises the mandible against the maxillae with great force. The masseter and the rest of the muscles of mastication are supplied by the mandibular nerve, a division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V).

### Q1.104
During a carotid endarterectomy, the _spinal accessory nerve_ (CN XI) is damaged with resultant weakness and atrophy of:

	A. Rhomboid major
	B. Teres minor
	C. Trapezius
	D. Levator scapulae
	E. Splenius capitis

#### Answer: C. Trapezius - TRUE
- The spinal accessory nerve exits from the jugular foramen and runs backward in front of the internal jugular vein in 66.6% of cases and behind it in 33.3%. The nerve then descends obliquely behind the digastric and stylohyoid to the upper part of the sternocleidomastoid; it pierces this muscle and courses obliquely across the posterior triangle of the neck, to end in the deep surface of trapezius. As it traverses the sternocleidomastoid it gives several filaments to the muscle and joins with branches from the second cervical nerve. In the posterior triangle it unites with the second and third cervical nerves, whereas beneath trapezius it forms a plexus with the third and fourth cervical nerves, and from this plexus fibres are distributed to the muscle.

### Q1.105
During cholecystectomy, which of the following _gross features of the gallbladder_ is noticed?

	A. The fundus is completely retroperitoneal - F
	B. The neck is wide and dilated - F
	C. The body is in relation, via its undersurface, with the start of the jejunum
	D. The cystic duct of the gallbladder courses independently to the duodenum
	E. The fundus of the gallbladder usually lies at the tip of the ninth costal cartilage, in the midclavicular line

#### Answer: C. The body is in relation, via its undersurface, with the start of the jejunum - *FALSE* = E. The fundus of the gallbladder usually lies at the tip of the ninth costal cartilage, in the midclavicular line - TRUE
- The gallbladder is a conical or pear-shaped musculomembranous sac, lodged in a fossa on the under-surface of the right lobe of the liver, and extending from near the right extremity of the porta to the anterior border of the organ. It measures from 7 to 10cm in length, 2.5cm in breadth at its widest part, and holds from 30 to 35ml. It is divided into a fundus, body and neck. The fundus, or broad extremity, is directed downwards, forwards and to the right, and projects beyond the anterior border of the liver; the body and neck are directed upwards and backwards to the left. The upper surface of the gallbladder is attached to the liver by connective tissue and vessels. The under-surface is covered by peritoneum, which is reflected on to it from the surface of the liver. Occasionally the whole of the organ is invested by the serous membrane, and is then connected to the liver by a kind of mesentery. The body is in relation, by its upper surface, with the liver, by its under-surface with the start of the transverse colon, and farther back, usually, with the upper end of the descending portion of the duodenum, although sometimes with the superior portion of the duodenum or pyloric end of the stomach. The fundus is completely invested by peritoneum; it is in relation in front, with the abdominal wall, immediately below the ninth costal cartilage; and behind with the transverse colon. The neck is narrow and curves upon itself like the letter S; at its point of connection with the cystic duct it presents a well-marked constriction. The cystic duct, about 4cm long, runs backwards, downwards and to the left from the neck of the gallbladder, and joins the hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.

### Q1.106
The Budd–chiari syndrome is a rare disorder characterised by marked narrowing and occlusion of the hepatic veins resulting in hepatomegaly, ascites and pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Which of the following statements about the _hepatic veins_ is true?

	A. They are arranged in two groups
	B. They enter the porta hepatis
	C. In a cross-section of the liver, they are grouped with a hepatic artery and hepatic duct
	D. They drain blood into the portal vein
	E. They contain valves

#### Answer: A. They are arranged in two groups - TRUE
- The hepatic veins start in the substance of the liver, in the terminations of the portal vein and hepatic artery, and are arranged in two groups: upper and lower. The upper group usually consists of three large veins, which converge towards the posterior surface of the liver and open into the IVC, whereas the IVC is situated in the groove on the back part of the liver. The veins of the lower group vary in number and are small in size; they come from the right and caudate lobes. The hepatic veins run singly and are in direct contact with the hepatic tissue. They have no valves.

### Q1.107
Neurolytic coeliac ganglia block is the therapy of choice for visceral upper abdominal pain that is resistant to therapy. Which of the following statements about the coeliac ganglia is true?

	A. They are placed on either side of the midline in front of the aorta and vena cava
	B. They are joined by the lesser splanchnic nerves in the upper part
	C. They are parasympathetic ganglia
	D. They are traversed by vagal (parasympathetic) fibres that do not synapse in the ganglia
	E. They receive postganglionic sympathetic fibres from the greater splanchnic nerves

#### Answer: D. They are traversed by vagal (parasympathetic) fibres that do not synapse in the ganglia - TRUE
- The coeliac ganglia (semilunar ganglia) are two large, irregularly shaped masses with the appearance of lymph glands; they are placed one on either side of the midline in front of the crura of the diaphragm close to the suprarenal glands, which on the right side are placed behind the IVC. The upper part of each of these sympathetic ganglia is joined by the preganglionic sympathetic fibres from the greater splanchnic nerve, whereas the lower part, which is segmented off and named the aorticorenal ganglion, receives the lesser splanchnic nerve and gives off the greater part of the renal plexus. The parasympathetic fibres from the vagi traverse these ganglia without synapsing.

### Q1.108
An aspiration needle inserted into the ninth intercostal space in the midaxillary line will enter:

	A. The cupola
	B. The cardiac notch
	C. The oblique pericardial sinus
	D. The costomediastinal recess
	E. The costodiaphragmatic recess

#### Answer: C. The oblique pericardial sinus - *FALSE* = E. The costodiaphragmatic recess - TRUE
- The costodiaphragmatic recess is the lowest extent of the pleural cavity or space. It is the part of the pleural cavity where the costal pleura changes into the diaphragmatic pleura. It is also the area into which a needle is inserted for thoracocentesis or pleural aspiration, and it is found at different levels in different areas of the thorax. At the midclavicular line, the costodiaphragmatic recess is between the sixth and eighth ribs, at the midaxillary line it is between the eighth and tenth, and at the paravertebral line between the tenth and twelfth. So, a needle inserted into the ninth intercostal space in the midaxillary line should enter the costodiaphragmatic recess. The cupola is the part of the pleural cavity that extends above the level of the first rib into the root of the neck. The cardiac notch is a structure on the left lung that separates the lingula below from the upper portion of the superior lobe of left lung. The oblique pericardial sinus is an area of the pericardial cavity located behind the left atrium of the heart. The costomediastinal recess is found where the costal pleura becomes the mediastinal pleura.

### Q1.109
While ligating the _ductus arteriosus_ it is important to avoid injury to:

	A. The thoracic duct
	B. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve
	C. The accessory hemiazygos vein
	D. The left internal mammary artery
	E. The left phrenic nerve

#### Answer: B. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve - TRUE
- The left recurrent laryngeal nerve is a branch of the vagus that wraps around the aorta, posterior to ductus arteriosus or ligamentum arteriosum. It then travels superiorly to innervate muscles of the larynx. It is important to protect this nerve during surgery. If the left recurrent laryngeal nerve became paralysed, a patient could experience a hoarse voice or even have difficulty breathing as a result of a laryngeal spasm. The thoracic duct is deep in the chest – it travels between the azygos vein and the aorta, posterior to the oesophagus. The accessory hemiazygos vein is a vein on the left side of the body. It drains the posterolateral chest wall and empties blood into the azygos vein. The left internal mammary artery is a branch of the left subclavian artery that supplies blood to the anterior thoracic wall. The left phrenic nerve runs lateral to the vagus nerve and its branches in the thorax; it is not close enough to be damaged by surgery on the ductus arteriosus.

### Q1.110
A 50-year-old man presents in an outpatient clinic with a lump in his groin, which on clinical examination was diagnosed as a direct inguinal hernia. His past history suggested that he had undergone an emergency appendicectomy almost 6 months previously. The direct inguinal hernia may well have been caused by iatrogenic injury at the time of appendicectomy to:

	A. The ilioinguinal nerve
	B. The subcostal nerve
	C. The femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve
	D. The genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve
	E. The ventral primary ramus of T10

#### Answer: C. The femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve - *FALSE* = A. The ilioinguinal nerve - TRUE
- A direct inguinal hernia is caused by a weakness in the abdominal muscles that prevents a patient from contracting these muscles strongly. The ilioinguinal nerve is important for innervating the muscles of the lower abdominal wall. Normally the falx inguinalis is pulled down to cover the thin area of weak fascia on the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. So, if this nerve were damaged during the appendicectomy, the man might not be able to contract his abdominal muscles and pull the falx inguinalis over the weak fascia. This could have led him to develop the direct inguinal hernia. The subcostal nerve and the ventral primary ramus of T10 innervate muscles, skin and fascia of the upper abdominal wall. These nerves are too superior to affect the inguinal region. The genitofemoral nerve innervates the cremaster muscle. An injury to this nerve would lead to an inability to elevate the testes, but it would not compromise the strength of the abdominal wall.


Questions 1.111-1.120
---------------------

40% = F: 113, 114, 115, 117, 119, 120

### Q1.111
Infection of the mastoid air cells could result from entry of bacteria through:

	A. The sacculus
	B. The cochlea
	C. The external auditory meatus
	D. The internal auditory meatus
	E. The nasopharyngeal tube

#### Answer: E. The nasopharyngeal tube - TRUE
- The nasopharyngeal (auditory) tube is a connection between the nasal portion of the pharynx and the tympanic cavity that allows pressure to equalise on both sides of the tympanic membrane. It is located in the anterior wall of the middle ear and comprises bone at the tympanic end and cartilage on the pharyngeal end. The pharyngeal mucosa is continuous with the lining of the tympanic cavity and mastoid air cells. This allows infectious material to pass to the middle ear and mastoid area. The sacculus is a fluid-filled sac that is part of the balancing apparatus of the ear; it is located in the vestibule of the ear. The cochlea is the organ of hearing that receives, interprets and transmits sound via the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII). The external auditory meatus is the opening in the temporal bone that allows sound waves to reach the tympanic membrane. The internal auditory meatus is the foramen in the temporal bone that allows the vestibulocochlear and facial nerves to pass into the skull at the base of the brain.

### Q1.112
A child was examined by an ENT consultant after iatrogenic rupture of his ear drum. The consultant examined the child for possible injury to a nerve that runs across the eardrum. The most likely nerve to be injured is:

	A. The glossopharyngeal nerve - F
	B. The mandibular nerve - F
	C. The chorda tympani nerve
	D. The lesser petrosal nerve - F
	E. The great auricular nerve - F

#### Answer: C. The chorda tympani nerve - TRUE
- Chorda tympani lies across the ear drum (tympanic membrane), so it is possible that this nerve was injured. Injury to the chorda tympani will result in loss of taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and no secretomotor innervation to the sublingual and submandibular glands. The mandibular nerve is not close to the ear and would not be damaged by the injury. The glossopharyngeal nerve and lesser petrosal nerve are associated with the promontory of the ear, which is on the medial wall of the middle ear. The great auricular branch of the vagus nerve is a small branch of the vagus that supplies afferent sensory innervation to the external acoustic meatus. This nerve is not close to the tympanic membrane.

### Q1.113
Chemodectoma is a benign tumour of the carotid body. Which of the following statements about the carotid body is true?

	A. It lies at the termination of the external carotid artery
	B. It is a baroreceptor
	C. It is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve
	D. It is similar to the coeliac ganglion
	E. It is a chemoreceptor that monitors serum sodium levels

#### Answer: B. It is a baroreceptor - *FALSE* = C. It is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve - TRUE
- The carotid body is innervated by the carotid branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve. It is a small, reddish-brown, ovoid mass that lies on the medial side of the carotid bifurcation, serving as a chemoreceptor that monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood. It is similar in structure to the coccygeal body, which is situated on the middle sacral artery.

### Q1.114
A 45-year-old woman underwent excision of the pisiform bone as a last resort treatment for painful arthritis involving the joint between the pisiform and a neighbouring carpal bone. Which of the following statements about the pisiform bone is true?

  	A. It is situated on a plane posterior to the other carpal bones
	B. It has a single articular facet
	C. It articulates with the trapezoid
	D. It gives attachment to the flexor carpi radialis (FCR)
	E. It gives attachment to the abductor pollicis brevis (APB)

#### Answer: D. It gives attachment to the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) - *FALSE* = B. It has a single articular facet - TRUE
- The pisiform bone is known by its small size and its presentation of a single articular facet. It is situated on a plane anterior to the other carpal bones and is spheroidal in form. Its dorsal surface presents a smooth, oval facet, for articulation with the triquetral: this facet approaches the superior, but not the inferior, border of the bone. The volar surface is rounded and rough, and gives attachment to the transverse carpal ligament and to flexor carpi ulnaris and abductor digiti minimi. The lateral and medial surfaces are also rough, the former being concave and the latter usually convex.

### Q1.115
Jugular foramen tumours are rare skull-base lesions that present diagnostic and complex management problems. Which of the following statements about the _jugular foramen_ is true?

	A. It is situated behind the carotid canal on the base of the skull
	B. It is divided into two compartments
	C. It transmits the mandibular nerve
	D. It transmits the transverse sinus
	E. It transmits the hypoglossal nerve

#### Answer: E. It transmits the hypoglossal nerve - *FALSE* = D. It transmits the transverse sinus - TRUE
- The jugular foramen, a large aperture formed in front by the petrous portion of the temporal and behind by the occipital, lies on the base of the skull behind the carotid canal. It is generally larger on the right than on the left side, and may be subdivided into three compartments. The anterior compartment transmits the inferior petrosal sinus, the intermediate the glossopharyngeal, vagus and accessory nerves, and the posterior the transverse sinus and some meningeal branches from the occipital and ascending pharyngeal arteries.

### Q1.116
Which of the following features help to identify the clavicle?

	A. It is a short bone
	B. It has a facet for articulation with the coracoid process of the scapula
	C. Its medial two-thirds are flattened from above downwards
	D. The anterior border of the lateral third gives attachment to the deltoid
	E. The posterior border of the lateral third gives attachment to the sternocleidomastoid

#### Answer: D. The anterior border of the lateral third gives attachment to the deltoid - TRUE
- The clavicle forms the anterior portion of the shoulder girdle. It is a long bone, curved somewhat like the italic letter f, and placed almost horizontally at the upper and anterior part of the thorax, immediately above the first rib. It articulates medially with manubrium sterni and laterally with the acromion of the scapula. It presents a double curvature, the convexity being directed forwards at the sternal end and the concavity at the scapular end. Its lateral third is flattened from above downwards, whereas its medial two-thirds has a rounded or prismatic form. The lateral third has two borders: anterior and posterior. The anterior border is concave, thin and rough, and gives attachment to deltoid. The posterior border is convex, rough and thicker than the anterior, and gives attachment to trapezius.

### Q1.117
The lumbrical muscles of the hand are vital for pianists and typists. Which of the following statements about the _lumbrical muscles_ of the hand is true?

	A. There are five in number
	B. They are associated with the tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis
	C. They are inserted into the distal interphalangeal joint of the corresponding finger
	D. They are all innervated by the ulnar nerve
	E. They assist in extension of the middle and distal phalanges

#### Answer: D. They are all innervated by the ulnar nerve - *FALSE* = E. They assist in extension of the middle and distal phalanges - TRUE
- The lumbricals are four small fleshy fasciculi, associated with the tendons of flexor digitorum profundus. The first and second arise from the radial sides and volar surfaces of the tendons of the index and middle fingers, respectively, the third from the contiguous sides of the tendons of the middle and ring fingers, and the fourth from the contiguous sides of the tendons of the ring and little fingers. Each passes to the radial side of the corresponding finger, and opposite the metacarpophalangeal articulation is inserted into the tendinous expansion of extensor digitorum communis, covering the dorsal aspect of the finger. By virtue of their insertion into the extensor expansion, they assist in extension of the middle and distal phalanges. The two lateral lumbricals are supplied by the sixth and seventh cervical nerves, through the third and fourth digital branches of the median nerve, whereas the two medial lumbricals are supplied by the eighth cervical nerve, through the deep palmar branch of the ulnar nerve. The third lumbrical muscle frequently receives a twig from the median nerve.

### Q1.118
Twisting of the ankle with forcible eversion during skiing will most probably sprain:

	A. The calcaneofibular ligament
	B. The anterior talofibular ligament
	C. The deltoid ligament
	D. The spring ligament
	E. The anterior tibiofibular ligament

#### Answer: C. The deltoid ligament - TRUE
- The deltoid ligament connects medial malleolus with talus, navicular and calcaneus. It is on the medial side of the ankle joint, and its role is to prevent the ankle from dislocating when forcibly everted. So, if a foot were strongly everted, the deltoid ligament could tear. The anterior talofibular ligament connects the lateral malleolus with the talus anterolaterally, and the calcaneofibular ligament connects the lateral malleolus with calcaneus. Both of these ligaments contribute to the lateral ligaments of the ankle and can be damaged during forced inversion of the foot. The plantar calcaneonavicular ligament (spring ligament) connects the sustentaculum tali with the plantar surface of the navicular bone. It provides major support for the medial longitudinal arch of the foot. The anterior tibiofibular ligament connects the tibia and fibula, providing support to the distal ends of these bones.

### Q1.119
The _rotator cuff_ of the shoulder joint will be affected by injury to:

	A. Teres major
	B. Supraspinatus
	C. Latissimus dorsi
	D. Pectoralis minor
	E. Deltoid

#### Answer: E. Deltoid - *FALSE* = B. Supraspinatus - TRUE
- The rotator cuff holds the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity of the scapula; supraspinatus is part of the rotator cuff. The four muscles that comprise the rotator cuff all insert on the greater or lesser tubercle of the humerus. Supraspinatus inserts into the upper facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus and the capsule of the shoulder joint. Infraspinatus inserts into the middle facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus and the capsule of the shoulder joint. Teres minor inserts into the lower facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus and the capsule of the shoulder joint. Subscapularis inserts onto the lesser tubercle of the humerus. The other four muscles listed are not parts of the rotator cuff.

### Q1.120
After a road traffic accident the injured driver is noticed to have injury to an _infraclavicular branch of the brachial plexus_. The nerve most likely to be involved is:

	A. The upper subscapular nerve
	B. The suprascapular nerve
	C. The dorsal scapular nerve
	D. The nerve to subclavius
	E. The long thoracic nerve

#### Answer: D. The nerve to subclavius - *FALSE* = A. The upper subscapular nerve - TRUE
- The brachial plexus is formed by the union of the anterior divisions of the lower four cervical nerves and the greater part of the anterior division of the first thoracic nerve; the fourth cervical usually gives a branch to the fifth cervical, and the first thoracic frequently receives one from the second thoracic. The plexus extends from the lower part of the side of the neck to the axilla. The branches of distribution of the brachial plexus for description purposes are arranged into two groups, namely those given off above and below the clavicle. The supraclavicular branches include the suprascapular nerve, dorsal scapular nerve, nerve to subclavius, long thoracic nerve and nerve to longus colli and scaleni. The upper subscapular nerve is an infraclavicular branch. The infraclavicular branches are derived from the three cords of the brachial plexus, but the fasciculi of the nerves may be traced through the plexus to the spinal nerves from which they originate. They are as follows: from the lateral cord arise musculocutaneous nerve (C5–7), lateral anterior thoracic nerve (C5–7), lateral head of median nerve (C6, C7), medial anterior thoracic nerve (C6, C7) and medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (C6, C7); from the medial cord arise the medial brachial cutaneous nerve (C8, T1), ulnar nerve (C8, T1), medial head of median nerve (C8, T1), upper subscapular nerve (C5, C6) and lower subscapular nerve (C5, C6); from the posterior cord arise thoracodorsal nerve (C5–7), axillary nerve (C5, C6) and radial nerve (C5–8, T1).
